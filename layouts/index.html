    <p>Hi, my name is Kush, I’m a perpetual productivity nerd, an occasional blogger, 
      sometimes a photographer, a frequent movie marathoner, a constantly <a href="https://krabf.com/coffee">caffeinated</a> human, chronically meticulous 
      <a href="https://krabf.com/works">video editor</a>, and most of the time thinking about the web, films, filmmaking and technology. I am based in the Philippines.
