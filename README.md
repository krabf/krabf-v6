### Personal website, built with Hugo

This is the source code for [krabf.com](https://www.krabf.com), a digital garden, a lifetime project filled with growing writings, reviews, and musing.

This site is created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), hosted in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and distributed globally via [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Posts are written in HTML and Markdown. Spent countless of hours with the CSS  â€” tweaking and learning other people's work and watching YouTube videos and reading some blog posts/docs. I am actively working to increase the accessibility and usability of my website to everyone. If you find some issues, please let me know.

If you have found my writing helpful or enjoyable, please consider making a [donation](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/krabf) to support my work. Even a small contribution goes a long way in keeping this blog active and ad-free.
