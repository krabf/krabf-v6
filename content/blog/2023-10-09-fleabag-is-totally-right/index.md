> Hair is everything. We wish it wasn’t so we could actually think about something else occasionally. But it is. It’s the difference between a good day and a bad day. We’re meant to think that it’s a symbol of power, that it’s a symbol of fertility. Some people are exploited for it and it pays your fucking bills. Hair is everything. - [Fleabag, S02E05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q97iIDx-b7U)

We all have this sort of dilemma about our hair that it’s something we can all relate to. Should we go long or short? Make a bold statement or stick to the classics? Keep up with the latest trends or embrace our unique style? It's a tough decision.

My partner and I discovered this great barbershop near our place. As we walk in, we can't help but notice the curious glances from other customers — after all, we're the only women getting our hair cut there. We've been going to this shop since early this year when my partner decided to embrace the mullet trend, and we wanted to see if this place could do it better than our previous go-to salon. Our previous salon had failed us, leaving our hair in a terrible state. It used to be my favorite salon in Cebu, but unfortunately, the hairstylist who knew exactly how I liked my hair no longer works there. And for someone who has trust issues, starting over with someone new made me hesitant.

We were fortunate to meet Kuya John at the new barbershop, who is, by the way, absolutely amazing. He's open-minded and always respectful. He even asks us how we prefer to be addressed, showing his genuine care. Surprisingly, he had worked at my previous go-to salon but had to leave for personal reasons. We really like and trust him completely with our hair. The barbershop has been a great experience for nearly a year now.

Getting a haircut is not just a physical change; it can also be an emotional experience. Our hair is a part of our identity, and how we choose to style it reflects our personality and preferences. It's a way for us to express ourselves and feel confident in our appearance. When we sit in the stylist's chair, we are putting our trust in their hands. We are entrusting them with something so personal and integral to our self-image. The fear of a bad haircut or not being able to communicate our desired style can create anxiety and hesitation.

A good hairstylist understands the emotional aspect of getting a haircut. They listen to our concerns, ask questions to understand our preferences, and take the time to create a style that suits us. They make us feel heard and valued, which helps build trust and makes the experience more comfortable. Growing up in a conservative environment, experimenting with my hair was a significant step, not just for my mother but for my entire family. When I nervously decided to try a shorter style with some *oomph*, my partner talked to the barber on my behalf. During my turn, I didn't say much because I was nervous and I don't have my glasses on, and when I don't have my glasses, I feel like I can't hear anything. It’s a weird and funny thing.  Yet, Kuya John helped me relax and lightened the mood with a joke about how light my hair felt. He assured me that everything would be fine and that trying something new would lead to self-discovery. It was a heartwarming experience that transcended a mere haircut. We even shared personal and professional stories, and before I knew it, we were almost done.

Finding a hairstylist who understands the emotional connection we have with our hair is a treasure. When you find that person, like Kuya John at the barbershop, it brings a sense of relief and satisfaction knowing that they genuinely care about our preferences and work to create a style that makes us feel good is priceless.

Fleabag really nailed it when she said, "Hair is everything." I've got to say, I totally get what she meant. Our hair can truly shape how we see ourselves. It's like our hair is this mirror reflecting who we are, showing our inner power, and also revealing our vulnerabilities and strengths.
