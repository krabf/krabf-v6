I bought the Things app replacing the clunky TickTick and Todoist. It is fast. People who talked about Things being fast were not kidding. I’ve been thinking about replacing the other to-do apps I used because it lacks features as I was just using the free version. I don’t like paying monthly or annually for an app that after using it for years (TickTick) is still clunky, and an app that is super clunky that it constantly has a new version update every 3 days (Todoist). And I don’t like paying subscriptions for apps in general. I’d rather just buy them for once—hence Things.

Here’s a hot take: There are a few things that I dislike about the productivity community and the idea of being productive. I dislike that people base their "productiveness" on the apps that are available to them. There used to be a time when people who did things digitally simply used the default Notes app on their devices to write their tasks. Nowadays, some people in the productivity community just search for other people's setups on the internet and copy them. While this is acceptable, where is the productivity in that? How can these people be sure that another's method is also usable for them? Do they have the same system? The same workflow? I know, I sound dumb, even I’m in the near spectrum of these kinds of people. But there are just people out there who buy apps and software that they won’t even use. In my case, I did my research on this and used the free trial. I can’t say that Things made me 10x more productive. The way Things is just works for me.

Things made sense to me after having my own tasks, project, and areas created. And this is why I just use my own workflow and systems when I’m buying apps or software. I’m really satisfied with the app. It has all the features I need to manage my tasks and projects efficiently, and the interface is clean and easy to use. I also appreciate that I only had to pay for it once, and that there are no recurring subscription fees. Overall, I think it was a great investment and I highly recommend it to those who are looking for a reliable and efficient task management app.

Buying the app was a BIG decision because it was hella expensive for me. The price is no joke, so you must be committed to using the app. And I have been playing around for a month now and I’m happy to say that I have been consistently using Things every day since I bought it. It has helped me stay on top of my tasks and projects, and I feel more organized and productive as a result. If you're someone who values efficiency and simplicity in task management, I would definitely recommend giving Things a try. However, if you're not willing to spend the money on it, there are other free apps out there that can also do the job.
