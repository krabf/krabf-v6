I have been struggling to form a writing habit for a while now, and it's been a source of guilt for me. I admit that I'm not naturally gifted at writing, and it's something that I'm insecure about. However, I do enjoy writing, so I feel bad when I don't do it. I've attempted to form this habit many times, but I always encounter the same problem: I don't know what to write about, or maybe I'm not putting in enough effort. At one point, I even considered creating a digital garden, but I was afraid of the level of commitment required to maintain my technical skills and keep up with reading. When it comes to technology, I only have a basic knowledge of Jamstack, HTML, and CSS, and that's from over nine years ago when I was making Neocities. I also thought about creating a newsletter, but then I wondered who my audience would be and what my "niche" would be. Writing is a complicated process, and even authors know this.

During my university days, I struggled with essays and screenplays. However, I've managed to make some progress over the years and develop my writing style. Some days, my writing process may be slow, but that's how I work. Nevertheless, I'm still not satisfied with my writing, and I know that I still have a long way to go.

So, I've decided to give writing another try. Maybe I'll attempt to write something today. Perhaps I'll write about my struggles with forming a writing habit and how I'm trying to improve. Maybe I'll even delve into how guilty I feel when I don't write. The possibilities are endless, and I'm excited to explore them.
