In recent years, there has been a surge in the talk surrounding productivity, with everyone from influencers to the average person on social media discussing it. However, productivity can be an elusive concept. We are constantly bombarded with the idea that a productivity app can help us get more done in less time, but we rarely stop to consider what it is we are actually supposed to be accomplishing. Is striving for productivity even making our lives better?

There seems to be a lot of hype surrounding productivity, with claims that being more productive will lead to greater success, more free time, and even more impressive accomplishments. But is this always the case? Is productivity always the right measure of success? While we may become more valuable to our organizations, companies, or significant others by being productive, the concept of being productive can be a myth. True success lies in ensuring that what we do is important and that we do it well.

The productivity community often becomes so focused on being productive that it ironically leads to being unproductive. It's like a never-ending cycle where the pursuit of productivity can sometimes hinder our actual effectiveness. We read countless articles, books, blog posts, Tweets, and watch YouTube videos all day long trying to figure out how to be more productive, how to be better at our jobs, how to make more money, how to be happier, healthier, and better versions of ourselves. We unfortunately often fail to apply what we learn, making resolutions to be more productive but rarely following through. It can be quite daunting when we first come across the term "productivity" or when we are told that if we just follow this one simple method, we will be more productive than ever before. We must be careful not to buy into the hype and remember that productivity is a journey, not a destination.

There will always be new techniques and strategies to learn, as well as improvements to make and work to be done. Productivity is an ongoing process that requires adjustments as we learn more about ourselves and the world around us. We do not have to be slaves to our calendars, task management apps, or any other "productivity app" we may have. The journey is more interesting than the destination, which is why we often become wrapped up in the latest and greatest productivity strategies. The most important thing is finding what works best for us and helps us be the most productive version of ourselves. Only then can we reach our goals and have the most fun along the way.
