The Philippines has suffered under leadership that prioritizes power and wealth over people's needs. While "vote wisely" sounds hollow when families must choose between principles and putting food on the table, we need electoral choices that truly serve working people.

Weâ€™ve been through so much. Weâ€™ve seen how corruption, incompetence, and greed have held us back for generations. We've watched political dynasties exchange power, while ordinary people continue to struggle. We deserve leaders who actually care, who show up not just for photo ops, but for real work, real service, and real progress. We deserve better.

Don't entrust your future to candidates who have repeatedly chosen self-interest over public welfare. Don't reward those who treat public office as a business opportunity, extracting resources while returning nothing of value to the communities they claim to serve.

So for this midterm elections, support candidates with proven records of standing with workers, farmers, indigenous peoples, and marginalized communities. Look for leaders committed to economic justice, environmental protection, and human rights â€” not just in their words, but in their actions and associations.

Iâ€™m exhausted. Like so many of us watching our collective hopes repeatedly betrayed by those who promised change but delivered more of the same oppressive systems.

So *please please please* vote for genuine public servants. The kind that isnâ€™t just promised during campaign season but is lived and felt every single day. Letâ€™s choose leaders whose service is grounded in compassion, integrity, and a deep respect for the Filipino people.
