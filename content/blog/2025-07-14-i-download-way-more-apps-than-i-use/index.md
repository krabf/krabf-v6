I read about Jack Baty’s [app deletion fiasco](https://baty.net/posts/2025/06/my-app-deletion-fiasco/) and yeah that kind of thing is never fun. I really hope it doesn’t happen to me especially since I’ve already had my fair share of [files being deleted](https://krabf.com/learning-patience/). But it got me thinking that it’s probably time I do my own cleanup, but in a more intentional way. I think I’m ready to start my own “Reduced & Simplified” journey.

I have this habit of downloading almost every software I see recommended on Reddit or by people I follow; hi [Lou Plummer](https://amerpie.omg.lol/?ref=krabf.com) A.K.A [AppAddict](https://appaddict.app/?ref=krabf.com)! I just can’t help myself. I try them out, tinker a bit, then forget about them because they don’t really fit into how I work. That’s where the problem is: I only use a handful of apps regularly — Apple Mail, NetNewsWire, Obsidian, Things, few utility apps and Zen. Plus whatever new browser I’m curious about at the moment (yes it's Dia). But I still have a bunch of RSS readers I was “trying out” months ago. There was that markdown editor I downloaded in March, two different weather apps (because apparently the built-in one wasn't good enough but also Hello Weather is just a joy to use and Windy is built different). And a pile of to-do apps I never used because they’re stuck behind a 7 day trial or a paywall.

So, that’s been my week. Going through both my Mac and iPhone, asking the hard questions: When did I last open this? Do I actually need another task manager when Things works fine? Why do I have three different PDF readers? The answer to most of these questions is embarrassingly obvious. I don't need them, I never use them, and they're just digital clutter taking up space.
