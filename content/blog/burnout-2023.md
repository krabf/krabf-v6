Ever met someone who's been burnt out from life and work? Nope, because she's been ignoring people for the past two months.

I was already tired before our trip to Manila last June. I was working on a project for two and a half months and it was really draining, mentally and physically. I complained to Denz everyday about the company and our client. And while I was in Manila, I received an update from our producer that the client wanted to start the project from scratch. And at that moment I just felt like all my artistic and technical abilities were overused for this project and I have nothing more to give. So added another one and a half months of doing this project. We finally wrapped up the project last week, which took almost four months!

Then Nooning got sick during the first week of July, and I became a worried mess. I prayed for days to the Universe that something good would happen, and that Noons would recover and be lively again. The experience was stressful as a co-furmom, and it was one hell of a responsibility. Crying after every vet visit, and waiting for hours on end for updates while Noons was in the hospital was overwhelming. I had never experienced something like this before because my Sophia was always dandy and sleeping, and she passed away from old age.

Nooning is doing great now! Her x-ray and CBC results are normal, but she just needs to go on a diet. I'm grateful that Denz and I made it through. Denz is the calm one who takes charge in these kinds of situations. It was a stressful time, but we got through it together.

I experience burnout every year, and it seems to be getting worse each year. I may seem okay on social media, but the truth is I'm feeling burnt out from work and life in general. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut and I don't know how to get out of it. I've been taking some time for myself, trying to do things that I enjoy, but it doesn't seem to be helping much. Maybe I need to take a longer break or try something completely new. All I know is that I can't keep going like this. It's not healthy for me or for the people around me.
