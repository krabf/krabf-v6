[Former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's arrest by the International Criminal Court](https://apnews.com/article/duterte-icc-drugs-court-philippines-hague-cb071416b50227275c42932c471dc0b7) was something I've been waiting to see for years. After all his controversial [drug war policies](https://www.hrw.org/tag/philippines-war-drugs) and those thousands of extrajudicial killings between 2016-2022, it feels like accountability and justice might finally be happening.

During college, I poured my heart into my research paper and thesis film on Duterte's brutal war on drugs. Those were some of the most stressful months of my academic life, but they were also incredibly fulfilling once I finally got my film on the subject out.

Now, seeing his arrest by the [ICC](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-philippines-rodrigo-roa-duterte-icc-custody) feels like a turning point not just for the country but also for all of us who have long awaited justice for the countless families affected by his policies.

But the fight for justice is far from over. There's still a disturbing number of Filipinos who worship Duterte as their "Tatay," demanding his release and crying injustice. [His daughter even filed a case](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2025/03/12/2427836/kitty-duterte-files-habeas-corpus-petition-bring-back-arrested-dad) challenging the arrest as "illegal" — the irony is staggering. **Where was this concern for legality when thousands were gunned down without warrants? Where was the outrage when entire communities lived in fear, when families lost loved ones who never even got their day in court?** The victims of the drug war deserve justice, not this selective amnesia about what happened during those dark years. Each person killed had a name, a family, dreams — and they never got the chance that Duterte is getting now: the right to a fair trial.
