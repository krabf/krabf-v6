I have to admit, I try to avoid movie trailers as much as possible because I don't want any spoilers. Even though they're only a minute-long, most trailers reveal too much in that short amount of time. I know even as filmmakers we make them for our projects, even if they're just shorts because they're effective.[^1] I even had a project in my Editing class way back in college where I did the same thing.

Of course, if it's a film that has a lot of buzz and everyone is talking about it, then I'll watch the trailer to see if it's worth my time. But when it comes to a recommendation from a trusted friend who has great taste in films, I prefer to go in blind and be surprised by what I see on the screen. I know it’s weird for a cinephile to skip trailers. Love me or hate me, call me a purist or whatever, but it's always a thrill to discover a great film without any preconceptions or expectations. But let's be real, sometimes I can't resist and end up watching them still.

Anyway, have you seen the trailer for Dune: Part Two? It's giving me goosebumps! I can't wait for its release on November 3. Time to get hyped!
