I hate the fact that I can't leave Facebook Messenger. My family and friends use it, while others use Instagram. I still use Instagram because art and film exhibits post their events there, and pet shops are also there. Nowadays, businesses run everything within Meta's bubble.

I don't blame people for this because everything on Meta is easily accessible.
