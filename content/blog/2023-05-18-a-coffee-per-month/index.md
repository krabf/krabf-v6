Many service providers price their services at $5 per month, as they believe that most people can afford this. They often compare it to the cost of a single cup of coffee each month.

Now, let's say you've stumbled upon a new service that only costs $3 per month. At such a low price point, you might think it's a no-brainer to subscribe, right? But have you taken a moment to consider all the other services you're already paying for? For those living in countries where the exchange rate is unfavorable, the cost of a $5 subscription could be significantly higher. I live in the Philippines, and I remember paying $5.30 for a $4.99 subscription. I mean, it's great if you can afford it, but for me, saying "it's only a coffee per month" doesn't really make sense. It's easy to overlook the small monthly charges, but they can add up over time.

I think there is no easy solution to pricing services. High prices may not seem like a necessary evil, but they are needed to ensure that service providers can maintain their business. Ultimately, we all deserve access to good things in life, and money is one of them. While offering a one-time payment option might sound like a good idea, it may not provide enough income for developers/services to support themselves for an entire year.

So it’s not really “a coffee per month” for some users. I honestly hate that analogy because not everyone has the same financial circumstances, and what might be affordable for some might be a significant expense for others. It's a delicate balance between affordability and profitability, and it's not easy to find the right solution for everyone.
