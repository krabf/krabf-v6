I can relate to this. I often on my laptop rather than my phone, which can cause frustration for my family and friends when I'm slow to respond to their messages. Being on my laptop allows me to be more productive and get more done.

One of my favorite ways to spend my spare time is by discovering new blogs. The content I come across often inspires me and gives me ideas for my own writing and hobbies. I have a particular appreciation for those who create [blogrolls](https://indieweb.org/blogroll) and [webrings](https://indieweb.org/webring), as they make it easier to find new and interesting content.

[Hundred Rabbits'](https://100r.co/site/home.html) [webring](https://webring.xxiivv.com/) is the one that first introduced me to the world of interconnected blogs and websites. From there, I fell down the rabbit hole and discovered a plethora of blogs with unique content and fascinating hobbies. It was a refreshing break from the common blogs created on platforms like Squarespace or Webflow. The webring allowed me to discover blogs that I wouldn't have found otherwise. And the best part? Each blog or website on the webring led to another webring, creating a never-ending journey of discovering new and exciting content. While I am not yet part of any blogrolls, I am planning to join one in the future.

If you're also interested in exploring new blogs, here are some webrings that I frequently visit:
