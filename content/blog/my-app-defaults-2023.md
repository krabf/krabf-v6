Inspired by [Kev Quirk’s post](https://kevquirk.com/my-default-apps-at-the-end-of-2023/?ref=krabf.com), I decided to share my list of default apps. This idea stemmed from [episode #097](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097/?ref=krabf.com) of _[Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com/?ref=krabf.com)_, where [Andrew Canion](https://andrewcanion.com/?ref=krabf.com) hosted a 'Duel of the Defaults' with [Jason Burk](https://grepjason.sh/?ref=krabf.com) and [Martin "Mr. Default" Feld](https://loungeruminator.net/?ref=krabf.com) to see who was the most default Mac user. In other words, who used the most default Apple apps and services on their Mac. [Rob Knight](https://rknight.me/?ref=krabf.com) has even compiled a [list of blog posts](https://defaults.rknight.me/?ref=krabf.com) with people’s default apps.

I appreciate blogrolls that help discover personal blogs.

I've included some apps that I use every day. While I attempt to use Apple's default apps, there are certain third-party apps that offer superior functionality.

Check [here](https://krabf.com/about/#:~:text=website%20to%20everyone.-,tools%20i%20use,-Hardware%3A%20General) to see more detailed information about the apps and software I use.
