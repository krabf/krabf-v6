The Balutakay Coffee Farmers Association (BACOFA) is a collective of smallholder coffee farmers residing in Sitio Pluto, Balutakay, Bansalan, Davao del Sur, Philippines. BACOFA strives to empower their members to become more successful and self-sustaining coffee growers in the region, by providing them with support, knowledge, and resources. BACOFA, led by Marivic Dubria, also works to improve the quality and sustainability of coffee production in the region, by providing their members with training and resources to help them better manage their farms.

Marivic Dubria’s aroma smells so good. This is one of those coffees that I’d be happy to just keep on smelling. This coffee uses their black honey process, and I think it’s the first one I’ve had using this particular processing method. And it’s also my first time trying a very coarse setting from the Comandante C40 (30 clicks!) From what I know, honey processed coffee don’t really use honey, it’s more of a hybrid between traditional washed process and natural processing. Honey coffees tend to be a little cleaner and less fermented than naturals, and it shows in this coffee. I think that this coffee definitely has some pineapple notes somewhere there. Towards the end of the sip there is a lemon presence and there is some spice coming through, like a black pepper, or more like cinnamon because of the aroma. This coffee is quite complex, and has a lot of structure. It sits forever on my palate in the aftertaste, which is not a new experience for me since I got this with other Philippine coffees.

My knowledge of Philippine coffee was limited when I got caught up in this rabbit hole. But I have come to appreciate the immense value that coffee roasters like Good Cup have in elevating local Philippine coffee. By collaborating with local coffee farmers, they create something special and delicious that both celebrates the heritage of Philippine coffee and introduces it to a wider audience. I'm grateful for the opportunity to experience the rewards of this delightful drink.
