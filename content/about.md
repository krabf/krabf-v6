    <p>Kumusta? My name is Kush (she/her), I’m an independent filmmaker, occasional blogger, sometimes a photographer, and most of the time a video editor based in Cebu City, Philippines. I recently joined the dynamic video team at <a href="https://technologyadvice.com/">TechnologyAdvice</a> as their Video Content Editor. Previously at <a href="https://fewstones.com/">fewStones</a>. You can visit my <a href="https://krabf.com/works">work site</a> and <a href="https://krabf.gumroad.com">Gumroad profile</a> to check some of the stuff I’ve created. If you're interested in knowing, here's what I'm up to right <a href="https://krabf.com/now">now</a>.</p>

Outside of work, I am a self-proclaimed serial hobbyist. Recently, I've taken a great interest in brewing coffee at home. I put a lot of time and effort into writing coffee reviews, and I'm working on transferring those to this blog, so please be patient. I love photography as well, and I try to publish my photos online, though I am generally shy about doing this. On any given day, I watch one or two movies.

I am fascinated by technology, especially ethical and useful technologies. I enjoy tinkering with the Internet. I spend most of my time these days thinking about the web — how it works, how it’s changing, and how we can make it a better place. The World Wide Web has always fascinated me. I feel as though I grew up on the Internet, and that it has taught me a lot of what I know. Technology has often found ways to pull me into new hobbies like making websites. I’ve made lots of websites that I forgot most of them.
