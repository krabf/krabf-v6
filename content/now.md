### Coffee stuff
In October 2021, I fell into the rabbit hole of coffee brewing for the first time and found a hobby that helped me through tough times. I love how coffee comes from different parts of the world and get a deeper appreciation for their differences. I promised myself that I would never make a profit from this hobby, and I am still trying to improve my skills.

### New work
I quit my job as a video editor for IPI and PERC this year. It was a good two years and I definitely learned a lot about mental health and the people working to make it as accessible as possible. While moving to Cebu City, one of my goals was to look for a job in order to grow and learn new skills. Later, I joined a Singapore-based video production company. 

### Freelancing
It's still possible to hire me for freelance work like logo creation or event coverage that includes photos and videos. However, I will need to check with my schedule first. I am also a Notion Ambassador, I am open to creating a Notion workspace for anyone who wants it. 

### Sobriety
Being sober has been one of the best things that ever happened to me. I must admit that it saved me a lot of money over the past four years, and it changed the way I live. My lifestyle has changed since then, and my family and friends have been very supportive, especially my partner. My rating of good restaurants is usually based on whether they offer mocktails or not. In my city, there are only three restaurants that offer mocktails. There is a possibility that I will make a project about this.

### Learning how to code
I love the internet. As I said, it has taught me a lot of what I know. I am still learning how to code.

### Health
Since my family appears to have inherited sickness, I am beginning my journey to living healthy in 2023. My first step should be to minimize my sugar intake. Then I decided to add exercise to my daily, or maybe weekly routine.
