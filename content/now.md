## Coffee stuff
Lately, I've been experimenting with my espresso routine. Nothing fancy but I'm shaking things up and experimenting with different milk options, those that are accessible to me of course. Maybe I'll go for a rich, velvety oat milk one day. Or perhaps a nutty, creamy almond milk is more my vibe. Heck, I might even get crazy and try something totally out there like the old classic fresh milk. The first two weeks weren't easy on my stomach, but I'm enjoying the exploration.

## Making
I'm still in the process of developing my [Coffee](https://krabf.com/coffee), [Photos](https://krabf.com/photos), and [Links](https://krabf.com/links) pages. But if you're interested in learning more about me, I've recently added a [Weeknotes](https://krabf.com/weeknotes) section where I share updates about my life.

## Work
I've parted ways with fewStones after almost two invaluable years of learning from exceptional editors, designers, and producers. It was a journey of constant growth. Now, I'm thrilled to join TechnologyAdvice as their new video content editor, combining my passion for tech and editing.

## Sobriety 
**I am seven (7) years sober this year**. Being sober has been one of the best things that ever happened to me. I must admit that it saved me a lot of money over the past four years, and it changed the way I live. My lifestyle has changed since then, and my family and friends have been very supportive, especially my partner. My rating of good restaurants is usually based on whether they offer mocktails or not. In my city, so far there are only four restaurants that offer mocktails. There is a possibility that I will make a project about this.
