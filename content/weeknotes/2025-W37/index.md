We're moving. After three years in our current place, we decided we wanted a bigger space that could actually fit both our desks and our dog. We've looked at about eight places in the last two weeks â€” so many that I sometimes forget which agent belongs to which apartment or which house was in what *barangay*. All that driving around after work (my night shift schedule was perfect for apartment viewings), then coming home and crashing, only to wake up and work again. No rest days for two weeks straight.
And we *FINALLY* signed the contract this week. We immediately were measuring everything, then went furniture and appliance shopping. All in the same day! We're this excited!

The whole moving process is exciting, fun, and absolutely exhausting all at once. Next comes the packing and the actual move. I'm already tired just thinking about it.
But I'm grateful I get to do this with my partner and that we're at a point in our lives where we can make this kind of change.
