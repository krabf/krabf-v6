I'm back in my hometown this week, juggling paperwork and *moving* stuff around. Ironically, I packed mostly workout clothes [determined](https://krabf.com/weeknotes/weeknotes40/) to kickstart a consistent exercise routine this month. Talk about the universe having other plans — I've been knocked flat with a nasty cold. Cough, congestion, headaches, the works. To top it off, I had a packed week of work meetings. Picture me on calls, voice almost as rough as sandpaper, camera off because, let's face it, I look about as fresh as week-old lettuce. So much for those workout plans! Seems like my only exercise this week has been reaching for is my [*lampin*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lampin).

✺ [Robtober '24](https://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2024/10/robtober/) has finally arrived, and I've been eagerly anticipating it since last August! I'm particularly intrigued to see The Omen franchise on the list, despite my childhood trauma associated with black dogs from those films. Growing up, I found horror movies terrifying, and the events in The Omen left a lasting impression. While I still hate watching horror movies, I've mastered the art of using friends and family as human shields during movie nights.
