I'm knee-deep in some serious planning for adulting decisions coming up next week. It's got me feeling a mix of exhaustion and anxiety that I can't quite shake. The weight of these choices is really hitting me hard. At this point, I'm pretty sure I'll need a solid five months of rest just to recover from the stress. It's one of those times when being an adult feels particularly challenging. Big girl decisions, big consequences, and a desperate need for a very long nap.
