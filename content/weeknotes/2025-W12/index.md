In Manila this week for a staycation with my work friends. These folks took me under their wing after everything went sideways, and it's been surprisingly and weirdly therapeutic. Venting about frustrations and stress while actually having fun feels like exactly what I needed. Never expected to find my people in this particular bunch, but I guess we just *clicked*

ðŸ”— [With Great Power Came No Responsibility](https://pluralistic.net/2025/02/26/ursula-franklin/#) - Enshittification, disenshittification, enshittifying, counterenshittificatory, antienshittificatory, and a lot more. This is a long one. But very much on point!

ðŸ”— [The hardest working font in Manhattan](https://aresluna.org/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/) *by* [Marcin Wichary](https://aresluna.org/) - Absolutely love this.

ðŸ”— Just found out about [Binocular Shot](https://binocularshot.com/). Part of me is disappointed because I've had this weird fascination with films featuring binocular shots ever since watching The Grand Budapest Hotel. Thought I might create something around this someday. But I'm also secretly pleased because now I have a list of films I've missed. Time to dive into some new viewing material.
