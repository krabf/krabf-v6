It's September 1st and I'm getting ready for the holiday season. Part of me is already feeling irritated just thinking about it — you know, the typical holiday stress and craziness. But I can't lie, there's another part of me that's kind of looking forward to it all. I can picture myself now, grumbling about the crowded malls and the endless Christmas jingles, only to catch myself humming along to those catchy Cebuano Christmas tunes a moment later. The Philippines just really takes Christmas to another level.

# The Week in Links

✺ [New Every Frame A Painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mn2Dcy-NDTw) video essay in _eight years_!

✺ [Tiny Awards just announced their winner for TinyAwards 2024](https://tinyawards.net/). Congratulations to everyone!

✺ [Metalabel](https://www.metalabel.com/) is a new space to release and collect creative work. Supported by a small, egalitarian team spread around the world. This one is very interesting and I really like how they view collaboration — a refreshing initiative that could reignite the original promise of the internet as a place for genuine creative collaboration, not just competition.

✺ [Shipping Tumblr and Wordpress](https://automattic.com/2024/08/27/shipping-tumblr-and-wordpress/)

> We’re not talking about changing Tumblr. We’re not turning Tumblr into WordPress. That would defeat the purpose. We acquired Tumblr to benefit from its differences and strengths, not to water it down.

> Running Tumblr on WordPress will make it easier to share our work across platforms. We can build something once and bring it to both WordPress and Tumblr. We can run Tumblr on the rock-solid infrastructure behind WordPress.com.

✺ [Departure Mono](https://departuremono.com/) is a monospaced pixel font by [Helena Zhang](https://www.helenazhang.com/) inspired by the constraints of early command-line and graphical user interfaces, the tiny pixel fonts of the late 90s/early 00s, and sci-fi concepts from film and television. Departure Mono's website is by the amazing [Tobias Fried](https://tobiasfried.com/).

✺ [Oasis is reuniting after 16 years!](https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/27/oasis-reunion-confirmed-for-uk-and-ireland-tour-in-2025-liam-noel-gallagher)

✺ [Chris Welch](https://www.threads.net/@chriswelch/post/C-8LF4BOSAP/) did a thread about how Google Pixel's New "Reimagine" feature that uses AI to make deepfakes easily accessible. The increasing sophistication of AI makes it harder for people to distinguish fake images from real ones, which could lead to a future where trust in visual media is severely compromised.

[John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/26/welch-reimagine-pixel-9):

> Everyone alive today has grown up in a world where you can’t believe everything you read. Now we need to adapt to a world where that applies just as equally to photos and videos.

✺ [End of the Road: An AnandTech Farewell](https://www.anandtech.com/show/21542/end-of-the-road-an-anandtech-farewell)

> "Still, few things last forever, and the market for written tech journalism is not what it once was – nor will it ever be again. So, the time has come for AnandTech to wrap up its work, and let the next generation of tech journalists take their place within the zeitgeist."
