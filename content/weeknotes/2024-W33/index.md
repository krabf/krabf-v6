I'm back in my hometown for the week, and I've been dying to check out all the new shops that have popped up. Unfortunately, the heat has made going out quite challenging. Surprisingly, it's even hotter here than in Cebu, which I hadn't thought possible. I had planned to do a photowalk the other day, but had to reconsider. It seems my plans for exploration might have to wait.
