Over the past two weeks, I've been testing three different web browsers. My "goal" is to thoroughly evaluate each one and determine which best suits my needs. This process has been more time-consuming than initially anticipated, involving extensive testing and customization of each browser. It's been a real pain in the ass. Two weeks of non-stop installing, tweaking, and fiddling with extensions.

I've noticed a tendency to default back to Arc, largely due to persistent issues with Firefox's performance. Interestingly, I've found [Zen](https://github.com/zen-browser)'s interface particularly appealing. It offers a user experience remarkably similar to Arc, despite being built on Firefox's framework. Who knew choosing a damn browser could be so complicated?

🌐 It's great to see [feeeed](https://feeeed.nateparrott.com/) gaining some well-deserved attention! I had the opportunity to try it out during the early beta stages when Nate first started sharing access. The app had its quirks and felt somewhat scattered. But even in that early stage, I was impressed by its core functionality.
