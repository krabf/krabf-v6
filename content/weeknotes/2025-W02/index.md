First week back at work, and my brain feels like it's running on Windows 95. Staring at my screen, second-guessing basic tasks I've done a thousand times before. It's funny how a holiday break can make you forget your entire professional identity. Everyone talks about the post-vacation blues, but no one mentions the temporary professional amnesia that comes with it.
