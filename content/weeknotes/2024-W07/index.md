Last week, Nooning started throwing up her food. After the first time, we rushed her to the vet. I don't usually panic when she vomits once, but my partner thought we should get her checked out since this was different. She threw up all her kibble, not just a little bit.

The vet gave Nooning some medicine and said to go to the animal hospital if she kept vomiting so they could check her vitals.  

On Tuesday the 13th, we took her to the hospital. I tried to distract myself while we waited for the test results because I tend to imagine the worst in situations like this. My mind races faster than Formula 1 cars when I'm anxious!

Luckily, there was no need to worry. We just have to watch if she vomits again or acts different. They prescribed a bunch of medications for Nooning and said we should adjust her diet. She needs to eat more but in a controlled way that's easy on her liver.

We were supposed to be in Manila this week on a little vacation, but we decided it was better to stay home until Nooning is back to normal. I guess our trip will have to wait until next time.
