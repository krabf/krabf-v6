I feel really grateful for the amazing feedback I got from my surgeon. Luckily, everything is fine and there's nothing to worry about. However, I still need to take a month or two to rest before I can start exercising. The first thing I'm planning to do is to go for a walk. It's such an easy and familiar activity that I've enjoyed before, and I think it'll be a great way to ease back into being active again.

I've been a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock for as long as I can remember. Rear Window definitely takes the top spot. It's a masterpiece that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The suspense, the brilliant storytelling, and the incredible performances make it a true cinematic gem. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend giving it a watch. Films like
