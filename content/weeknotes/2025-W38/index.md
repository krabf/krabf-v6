It's the 53rd anniversary of Martial Law being declared in this country, and here I am out on the streets again. The Philippines has had enough of these corrupt politicians and their endless bullshit.

Just look at what's happening right now. This massive [flood control scandal](https://www.abs-cbn.com/news/nation/2025/9/11/a-timeline-of-the-philippine-flood-control-scandal-0600), billions of pesos disappearing into thin air while our communities are drowning. They're literally stealing from us while we're underwater. The audacity is almost impressive if it wasn't so enraging.

I'm exhausted. We're all exhausted. But I'm still here. I'm not giving up, because this fight isn't just about me, it's about all of us. We all deserve better than this. We deserve a government that actually works for the people, not one that treats the national budget like their personal ATM.
