My first week at the new job was filled with informative training sessions and a warm welcome from the team. It was a bit exhausting, but I loved getting to know the ins and outs of the company and familiarizing myself with the team. It's all newbie stuff generally. I am fortunate to be part of a wonderful and supportive team. This level of support is new to me, but it reassures me that I'm in good hands.

I also got to watch some Wong Kar-wai films this weekend thanks to Film Development Council of the Philippines, through their FDCP Presents: A Curation of World Cinema! They actually have a bunch of [programs](https://www.fdcp.ph/updates/fdcp-unveils-programs-and-initiatives-first-quarter-2024) coming in this Summer 2024 but it's starting off very strong.

# The Week in Links

üì∞ I have been playing New York Times new word game [Strands](https://www.nytimes.com/games/strands)

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª [Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/) hosted the February edition of the IndieWeb Carnival on the theme of [Digital Relationship](https://manuelmoreale.com/indieweb-carnival-digital-relationships) and he recently did a fantastic [roundup](https://manuelmoreale.com/indieweb-carnival-roundup). I have been reading them and it kind of inspired me to write one despite being a month late.

üó£Ô∏è How to Have More Meaningful Conversations by [Charles Duhigg](https://time.com/author/charles-duhigg/) - I'm no supercommunicator but I do like talking and listening to people sometimes and when I do *engage* with people, I often do the "looping for understanding" thing.
> Looping has three steps: Ask a question; repeat back what you heard in your own words; and then ask if you got it right.

 I really liked the article and now I'm happily listening to the audiobook. It's very interesting!

‚úçüèª How to Build a Better Writing Habit by [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://nesslabs.com/author/annelaure) - This is pushing me to dive into reading and writing more. My goal for this year? To finish at least one book. You see, I'm more of a video and film buff, and reading hasn't always been my thing. But, I know if I want to be a good writer, I've got to read more. Since my attention can be a bit all over the place, I'm starting my reading journey with audiobooks. And yes, I just made this decision this week!

<figcaption>I've been hearing the song Unwritten by Natasha Bedingfield everywhere recently. And then I remember that it was the original soundtrack in <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1072790-anyone-but-you">Anyone But You</a>. I'm a big fan of feel-good romcoms, and I've loved this song since its release</figcaption>
