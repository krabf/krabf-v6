Last Wednesday marked the end of an important chapter in my professional life as I bid farewell to my position at fewStones. Over the course of the last two years that I've spent there, I've had the immense pleasure and privilege of learning from some of the most fantastic editors and incredibly gifted graphic designers in the industry. It's been a journey of constant learning, growth, and professional development for me. The opportunity to work alongside such a talented and collaborative team has been nothing short of a blessing. I feel extremely fortunate to have been part of this wonderful team that not only elevated my work but also enriched my experience in countless ways.

As I gear up for a new adventure in a *more* formal corporate world, I've set aside a few days to recharge and adjust to my soon-to-be night schedule (hello, US hours! Or as what others call it, "graveyard shift"). I'll still be helping folks create content through multimedia design, but now in the exciting world of a tech company.

# The Week in Links

🗞️ Vice Is Dead via [Pixel Envy by Nick Heer](https://pxlnv.com/linklog/vice-is-dead/) - I grew up reading Vice articles and it was where I get my news from other countries. This news is sad because Vice is one of the media sites that has the best coverage on the APAC art scene, especially from [Manila Community Radio](https://www.vice.com/en/article/epvdnw/manila-community-station-radio-music) shows.

📷 The [Fujifilm X100VI](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x100vi/) has been released and is now available for pre-order. I skipped on the X100V but after seeing reviews and photos of the X100VI, I'm considering purchasing one 👀

I didn’t know this song had layers and layers of sample!
