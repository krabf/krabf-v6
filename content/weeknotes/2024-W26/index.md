> Sorry for the late update on the weeknotes, I was in Manila for my first (non-virtual) company event (which I will write about next week)

I caught a screening of National Theatre Live: Fleabag on the big screen last June 25. And thank you [CCP](https://culturalcenter.gov.ph/press-release/experience-the-best-of-british-theater-a-second-time-around-with-new-ccp-ntl-season/) for bringing this show in Cebu! By the halfway point, I was in tears, overwhelmed by the experience of seeing my favorite show and person larger than life. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is an absolute genius — in my opinion, she's the best writer out there right now. If I could have a phone call with anyone, it'd be her. I'd love the chance to tell her how much her work meant to me during the pandemic, how it kept me going through those tough times. Her humor and honesty were like a lifeline when I needed it most.

# The Week in Links

✺ I recently got the [Aer Travel Pack 3 Small](https://aersf.com/collections/backpacks/products/travel-pack-3-small?country=PH), which I believe is ideal for one-bag travel. I used it during my trip to Manila last weekend and found it super! People who have of this bag in the EDC *cult* are not exaggerating when they praise its versatility. While it has a technical and masculine appearance, I don't view this negatively given its functionality. I'm pleased with the bag overall. 

✺ The [Boox Palma](https://shop.boox.com/products/palma) has gained significant attention recently, with many people expressing positive opinions about it. The e-paper device market is experiencing rapid growth and innovation, making it challenging to stay current with all the new developments. BUT I would still opt for an [iPad mini](https://www.apple.com/ph/ipad-mini/)(Apple, please add M4 chips on the iPad minis!) with cellular data or the [Samsung Galaxy Tab A9](https://www.samsung.com/ph/tablets/galaxy-tab-a9/buy/). I don't read much; instead, I mainly watch films and TV series.

✺ The [Leica D-Lux 8](https://leica-camera.com/en-int/photography/cameras/d-lux/d-lux-8) is here... and it looks a bit like the Leica Q3? 17MP from the 22-megapixel ***micro four thirds*** CMOS image sensor paired to a 10.9-34mm f/1.7-2.8 DC Vario-Summilux lens. Interesting how this would compare to Ricoh GRs and Fujifilm's X100 cameras.

✺ Replaced Bartender with [Ice menu bar tool](https://icemenubar.app/). Simple but powerful!

✺ Stack the deck with [Figma Slides](https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-slides/)

✺ [13 Films to See in July](https://thefilmstage.com/13-films-to-see-in-july-2024/)
