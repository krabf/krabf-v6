We had a 6.9 magnitude earthquake last September 30 around 9:59 PM. The epicenter was in Bogo, Cebu, but we felt it strong here in the city and neighboring regions too. Everything was shaking. It was the fastest I've ever moved in my life. Grabbing the dog took 0 seconds, grabbing my phone took 1 second, and getting down the stairs and out the door took 2 seconds flat.

I've been looking into relief efforts and donation drives for affected areas. If you want to help, here are some NGOs and organizations accepting donations:

The links here are from Facebook since it's the most accessible way of communicating other people from different places here in the Philippines.

It's been a particularly stressful few days because we're still in the middle of moving, with so much left to sort out. We're maybe 30% settled in the new place and still need to get furniture. Between the earthquake and the move, it's been a lot to handle all at once.
