Spent the weekend with some artists talking about the challenges of the creative scene in Cebu, especially the need for a third space or safe space. We used to have Kukuk’s, which was probably the best place to just be yourself, but sadly, it’s long gone. Waiting (and excited) for the group to come together and turn the organization into something meaningful.

> Blogging forces clarity. It makes you structure your thoughts, sharpen your perspective. You stop writing fluff because — let’s be honest — you’re writing for yourself. And if you can’t keep yourself interested, nobody else stands a chance.

> When you write, you think better. When you think better, you create better.
