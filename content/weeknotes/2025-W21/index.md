Spent most of this week untangling the mess I made with my Links page. Originally threw everything into one giant index file because I thought using shortcodes would be clever. Turns out, not so much. The whole thing fell apart when I tried setting up RSS feeds. Now each section has its own file, which makes way more sense. RSS works, updates are easier, and I don't have to scroll through a thousand lines of code just to add one link. Sometimes the simple way is the right way.

Yep, Naked hits differently. Can't exactly recommend it to most people, but if you're in one of those existential spiral dread and want something that matches the energy, it's perfect for that.
