Being a woman with large feet is incredibly frustrating, especially when shopping for shoes. This has been my problem growing up. It would usually end up me crying in the corner of a department store because I am so tired of hopping from one boutique to another and try on a size that fits. It's a constant struggle to find my size, even in the men's section! I was about to give up hope, but thankfully, Foot Locker came through with a men's size that actually fits me.

üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ RIP James Earl Jones. [Here's him reading Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXU3RfB7308).

Ô£ø The iPhone 16 lineup is built for¬†[Apple Intelligence](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/09/apple-intelligence-comes-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-starting-next-month/)¬†and introduces Camera Control. The Capture button will be a solid state capacitive button, with haptic feedback supplied by a built-in Taptic engine which mimics how a physical button would react when pressed. Neato. And for someone who still has the iPhone 12 Pro, I am eyeing for this upgrade that for sure will last me for another 5 years.

Ô£ø Next, we have Apple's new "Hearing Aid Feature" for AirPods Pro 2, approved by the FDA, transforms them into personalized hearing aids via a software update. It targets adults with mild to moderate hearing loss, offering accessibility and affordability compared to traditional hearing aids.

üì∑ Leica recently released a new addition to the M-Cameras, the [Leica M11-D](https://leica-camera.com/en-int/photography/cameras/m/m11-d-black). The M11-D enables images with a resolution of either 60, 36 or 18 MP. With a cache of 3 GB, continuous shooting of up to 5 pictures per second with 60 MP is possible. With ISO range from native ISO 64 to ISO 50,000. Full specs is on the [Red Dot Forum](https://www.reddotforum.com/content/2024/09/leica-m11-d-cutting-edge-digital-with-analog-feel/) website. The M11-D also had the hardware-based Leica Content Credentials technology (based on the [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://leica-camera.com/en-int/news/partnership-greater-trust-digital-photography-leica-and-content-authenticity-initiative) framework) that we saw on the [M11-P](https://leica-camera.com/en-int/photography/content-credentials) to protect the authenticity of digital images.

> The Leica M11-D brings the analogue experience to digital photography, but without creating limits. With the Leica FOTOS app, you can integrate the digital workflow into your work whenever you want. Use your device as a camera display to assess your shots and adjust nearly all camera settings to your liking. Once saved, your settings are locked in. The Leica FOTOS app also enables photo transfer, remote control, geotagging and direct editing in Adobe Lightroom, Capture One Pro or the Darkroom app.

TIL that this is the Tagalog version for the infamous "The quick brown fox..." but the character encoding issue on the website for **√±** is so funny.

> Libraries are critical infrastructure. Access to information is a human right. When you buy a book you should¬†[truly own it](https://www.citationneeded.news/we-need-to-talk-about-digital-ownership/). When a library buys a book, they should be able to lend it. Readers should be able to read without any third parties spying over their shoulders, or preventing them from accessing the materials they have legally obtained.
