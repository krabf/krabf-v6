Work hit a new level of busy this week. This year, I'm making a conscious effort to push past my usual boundaries and step up more. Been saying yes to responsibilities that could strengthen both my skills and our team's workflow. To be clear, I'm still not aiming for a leadership role. Managing a team is definitely outside my comfort zone, but more importantly, I question how effective I'd be steering others when some days I can barely keep my own ship on course. But there are plenty of other ways to contribute, and I'm proud of myself for finding my own path to add value.

Shifting to personal stuff, I'm back in the province this week at my mom's request. She has a special talent for getting me to *drop everything* and come help. It's not that I don't want to see her or be back home ‚Äî I just prefer some advance notice to properly plan leaving the city. Usually need a week or so to make sure everything's settled with Nooning and Denz in Cebu. But this is just a quick trip, then it's back to regular programming. I have to thank to my family for making every coming home worthwhile. Even just one day filled with home-cooked meals and genuine laughter is enough to make the trip count. Funny how it always happens ‚Äî as soon as I'm heading back to the city, I'm already thinking about when I can come home again.
