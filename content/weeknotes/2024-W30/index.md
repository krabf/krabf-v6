I was really hoping to catch Longlegs and the new Twisters movie on the big screen this week, but it looks like that's not happening. Some big Marvel "blockbuster" just dropped, and now it's hogging all the showtimes.

Watched A Quiet Place: Day One at home instead. The tension was palpable, as the cat's fate kept me on edge throughout the film.

# The Week in Links

üêô Trying out [Openvibe](https://openvibe.social/) this week. Openvibe promises to combine your decentralized social media accounts, Mastodon, Bluesky, Nostr, and soon Threads, into one timeline. While I don't maintain an active social media presence, I frequently browse Reddit and Threads. I'm still on Mastodon but don't really do much there. I've found myself returning to Twitter more often lately, as most of the people I look up to remain active on the platform and of course I don't want to miss all the *Pinoy Kanal Culture*‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.
