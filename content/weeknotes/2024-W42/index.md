I'm upgrading my remote work setup, starting with a compact monitor. Key priorities are eye comfort for long hours and compatibility with my M3 Pro work device. Budget is a concern since I'll mainly use it for holiday breaks and occasional trips home. I'm considering the [UPERFECT monitors](https://www.uperfectmonitor.com), which is available in the Philippines. An iPad is out since it'll be my personal device so I could have something to browse and watch media.

If you have experience with good portable monitors, I'd love your recommendations!

📱 [Louie Mantia](https://lmnt.me/), who runs [Parakeet Inc.](https://parakeet.co/) with [Luka Grafera](https://grafera.zone/), has always been one of my favorite icon designers. Recently, Louie created a [custom app icon for Apple's iPhone Mirroring](https://lmnt.me/blog/sketchbook/iphone-mirroring.html) feature that just makes sense. His design perfectly captures the essence of the mirroring function, improving on Apple's original icon. It's another example of why I admire Louie's work.

👩🏻‍💻 [POSSE: Reclaiming social media in a fragmented world](https://www.citationneeded.news/posse/)
> When platforms die, there is inevitably community loss as the userbase fragments. Some people move to the same platforms but never manage to reconnect. Others migrate to different services that don’t interoperate. Some vanish entirely. Each shift requires rebuilding, and the process of finding the people you once knew and the communities you once valued is laborious. Each shift takes its toll, and everyone has a limit of how much energy they’re willing to expend on a new platform that will eventually, like its predecessors, join the graveyard of defunct websites. And with the shift, old posts and conversations are lost to abandoned accounts or, eventually, server shutdowns.

📦 ["Millennials are saying, 'No, I don't want your stuff. I barely want my stuff.'"](https://archive.is/20241014163340/https://www.businessinsider.com/millennial-gen-x-boomer-inheritance-stuff-house-collectibles-2024-10) - This is so relatable. Every middle-class Filipino family seems to have a hoarding problem, passing down stuff to children who don't want it A.K.A me. In our house, this turns into a yearly debate each December when we tackle the dreaded cabinet cleaning. It's our annual tradition of arguing over what to keep and what to finally let go.

📰 [You should be using an RSS reader](https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/#read-receipts-are-you-kidding-me-seriously-fuck-that-noise) - I've always had a soft spot for RSS since I was younger. When Tumblr added RSS support, I jumped on it to keep tabs on my favorite blogs. It's such a handy tool that I even pitched it at work as a way to stay updated on news. There's something satisfying about having all your content neatly organized in one place, without the noise of social media or ads even!

◼️ I can't pinpoint exactly when I first stumbled upon Minimalissimo, but it definitely coincided with my college-era fascination with minimalism. Now, hearing that Minimalissimo is [hibernating](https://buttondown.com/minimalissimo/archive/minimalissimo-edited-2670/) is making me sad.
