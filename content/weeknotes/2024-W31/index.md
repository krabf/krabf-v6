# The Week in Links

✺ [Tiny Awards 2024 voting is open!](https://tinyawards.net/)

✺ [Public.Work](https://public.work/?ref=krabf.com) by Cosmos. An immersive search engine for *public domain* content. I have just deleted the iOS app few days ago since I haven't opened the app for the past 3 months but I guess that's going to change.

✺ E.L. Guerrero's webzine, [some eyes see you (some eyes do not see you)](https://some-eyes-see-you.glitch.me/) for a WAN (Wide Area Network) Party, is based on a [David Shrigley postcard](https://shrigshop.com/products/david-shrigley-postcard-some-eyes-see-you) print with excerpts from [John Cage's Diary](https://www.ubu.com/sound/cage_diary.html).

✺ [Bruce Lee's Never-Before-Seen Writings on Willpower, Emotion, Reason, Memory, Imagination, and Confidence](https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/08/01/bruce-lee-notebook/?ref=krabf.com)

✺ New browser in browser town. [Zen](https://get-zen.vercel.app/). A Firefox based browser with a focus on privacy and customization. It's been getting a lot of good feedback in r/browsers but the macOS installation is a pain in the ass because it's not yet fully supported so you'd have go to terminal and do the technical side of things to keep Apple from flagging Zen browser as unsafe.

✺ [The Origin & Evolution of Italian Stuffed Pasta Shapes](https://kottke.org/24/07/the-origin-evolution-of-italian-stuffed-pasta-shapes?ref=krabf.com) *via* [kottke.org](https://kottke.org?ref=krabf.com)

✺ [Hi, I'd like order a $1.8M domain, please.](https://archive.is/20240801205005/https://www.404media.co/ai-friend-company-spent-1-8-million-and-most-its-funds-on-domain-name/) The CEO of this new wearable AI watched Her and immediately resonated with it.

✺ [Filipinos want the country’s biggest YouTube star to be their next president.](https://restofworld.org/2024/raffy-tulfo-philippines-president/?ref=krabf.com) Nope, not me.
