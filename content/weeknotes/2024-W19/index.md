I'm in Singapore with Denz. We've been planning this getaway for over a year now because we've been talking about possibly moving here for a while, so we figured we'd come check it out properly before making any rash decisions.

I've been to Singapore once before, but it was just a quick few days as a starting point for our Banana Pancake Trail backpacking adventure across Southeast Asia. Even though it was a short stay, I had an unforgettable experience getting lost in the vibrant Little India neighborhood. It really opened my eyes to how different life can be in an ultra-modern city compared to the third-world country I was so accustomed to.

This visit we're doing the full tourist thing — hit up Universal Studios, Gardens by the Bay, you name it. But we're also getting a real taste of local life by eating our way through all the incredible Hawker Centres and commute and walk 15,000 steps a day (with this heat is too much.) Huge perk is that Denz's relatives live here and are putting us up, saving us a ton on accommodation.

We'll see how we feel after really experiencing Singapore for an extended stay. But so far, so good!

My RSS feed game is an absolute mess right now. I was out of town for the past couple weeks on a little adventure (still am), and in that time my feed just completely blew up to over 3,000 unread articles! I'm trying my best to power through and get caught up, but let's just say it's been a slow crawl. So if you notice me being a little behind on sharing links from the last couple of weeks, just know I'm working on it! Bear with me while I chip away at this mountain of a backlog.
