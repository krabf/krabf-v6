I ended up being the point person this week, which somehow meant spending more time coordinating in Slack than actually working on my own projects. Everyone seemed to be operating on different wavelengths, and nothing was in sync. I was already feeling drained the week before, but this week pushed me over the edge.

On the bright side, I managed to finish our itinerary for the birthday trip. I've mapped out the spots to visit. We're doing another onebag challenge, so we're already mentally sorting through what clothes we *actually* need versus what we *think* we need. Plus figuring out which meds to stock up on since we're running low.

Preparation week has officially begun. We're booking tours this weekend. After that, all that's left is the actual travel. Finally something to look forward to!
