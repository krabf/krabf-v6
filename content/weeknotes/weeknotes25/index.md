Watching Dark has been one of the most confusing TV experiences I've had. When it first came out, I barely made it through episode one before giving up. It just felt too pretentious - all those philosophical lines and characters that seemed to be waiting for their cue to say something profound. The whole thing struck me as trying too hard. But for some reason, I decided to give it another shot.

Now I'm in Season 3, the final season, and I still have mixed feelings. Part of me feels stupid for sticking with it. The writing often comes across as overly self-important, and there are times when I'm scoffing at the dialogue or scenes. Yet here I am, pushing through to the end. Maybe it's stubbornness, or maybe it's genuine curiosity about how they'll wrap everything up. I'm not sure if I'll end up feeling satisfied or if I'll regret the time I've invested.
