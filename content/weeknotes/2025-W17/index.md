I spent most of my Friday, outside of work, watching and rewatching all of [OK Go](https://okgo.net/)’s music videos, especially the classic one with the [treadmills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTAAsCNK7RA). They recently released a new video for their song *[Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz9BRl7DVSM)*, and it’s absolutely beautiful. Every OK Go video is so out of the ordinary, it really makes you wonder how they even come up with these ideas.

> I want to avoid nicheifying myself and my work—[trapping myself in any one "frame."](https://fromemily.com/hi-im-terrified/#hi-im-existentially-angsty-as-fuck) I want this website to hold space for work that is joyous, irreverent, snarky, deadly serious, utterly frivolous, poignant, pointless, labored over, shat out in a sitting, inspiring, helpful, self-indulgent, humorous, biting, sarcastic, empathetic, armored, vulnerable, and ALL THE THINGS I am and can be all at once. I want this website to reflect (as much as a website can) the fullness of a human. (No pressure, website...)

🔗 [The Movie Mistake Mystery from "Revenge of the Sith"](https://fxrant.blogspot.com/2025/04/the-movie-mistake-mystery-from-revenge.html) -  Ever since I took an editing class and worked hard to be the “best” AD in class and even in town. I’ve always been obsessed with making sure continuity is tight and schedules are followed. But no matter how much we plan and double-check, there are still mistakes that show up later, whether in post or during public screenings. It’s frustrating because these are things we thought we had under control but clearly didn’t.
> ...the process of “cleaning up” a film for newer formats like Blu-ray and 4K — which is deeply wrong. This is a much bigger topic on which I have very strong thoughts and the hottest of takes.

I actually have the same thoughts. trying to "clean them up" often just erases a lot of the original feel of these films. I'd rather watch something a little rough around the edges than something that looks unnaturally polished.
