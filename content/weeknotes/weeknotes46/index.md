Running on three hours of sleep lately (do not recommend!) which explains the nasty migraines and getting sick.

Anyway, after testing alternatives since the Omnivore shutdown announcement, Readwise Reader still comes out on top. Planning to ask for a discount after my 30-day trial ends. For now, I'm getting by with Obsidian Web Clipper and MarkDownload extension for saving articles directly to Obsidian.

# The Week in Links

🦋 Fifteen million people, yes, [15 MILLION](https://www.engadget.com/social-media/bluesky-surges-to-15-million-users-after-getting-a-million-sign-ups-in-one-week-224213573.html), are moved to Bluesky this week. [I'm also over there, mostly lurking](https://bsky.app/profile/krabf.com).  But I'm mostly in this blog. POSSE.

📱 [IMG_0416](https://ben-mini.github.io/2024/img-0416) *by* [Ben Wallace](https://ben-mini.github.io/) - It's fascinating how accidental uploads and default titles from Apple's "Send to YouTube" era created an authentic archive of everyday life, blending randomness with nostalgia on YouTube.

🖼️ [The West Cook Archive](https://wescook.art/) is finally up online! Thank you, Cabel Sasser.

🎞️ [The Blair Witch Project Limited Edition 2-Disc Blu-ray](https://secondsightfilms.co.uk/products/the-blair-witch-project-limited-edition-blu-ray-pre-order-available-november-11th) - In celebration of its 25th anniversary, I finally tried getting The Blair Witch Project from Second Sight Films. Sadly, it's out of stock (they promise more soon). If you haven't seen this found-footage classic yet, you absolutely should! It's iconic and still finding new audiences after all these years.

🧅 The Onion just bought InfoWars, [here's why](https://theonion.com/heres-why-i-decided-to-buy-infowars/).

 Apple's making big moves in creative software, from updating Final Cut Pro to acquiring Pixelmator. While Adobe still dominates the enterprise space with their AI features, many creative pros are looking for alternatives. [Apple's timing couldn't be better](https://petapixel.com/2024/11/14/apple-smells-blood-in-the-water/), focusing on performance and tight ecosystem integration, they're positioning themselves as a serious challenger to Adobe's creative suite dominance.

⛈️ [Four simultaneous storms rage in the West Pacific,](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/12/climate/philippines-storms-west-pacific-intl-hnk/index.html) a direct result of "warming" oceans. The recent typhoons in the Philippines expose [a deeper issue](https://www.ibon.org/ph-disaster-preparedness-neglected/): the government's reactive approach to disasters isn't working. Instead of meaningful infrastructure improvements and environmental protection, the Marcos administration, like its predecessors, [continues to prioritize business interests](https://www.ibon.org/bbm-admin-to-foreigners-take-our-land-please/) over people's welfare and proper disaster preparedness. The country needs a shift from mere response to actual prevention, putting community needs and environmental protection first.

Another awesome video from Answer in Progress

Though I've been trying to run consistently since January, progress has been slow, dealing with foot issues, broken shoes and, well some laziness about getting out there. But I'm proud of one thing: I don't beat myself up when I need to take it easy. After all if getting fit was simple, everyone would be doing it. Taking it one step at a time, quite literally.
