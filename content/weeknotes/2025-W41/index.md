We're still experiencing tremors here in Cebu Province and the city. I wouldn't even call them aftershocks anymore since some hit 5.0 or higher. I keep my go bag within sight at all times and stay alert. I'm more aware of my surroundings than ever, but I also know that no amount of preparation can account for everything.

What's been really moving to see is how everyone here in Cebu is looking out for each other. There's this sense of community that I've missed. People genuinely checking in, sharing updates, making sure neighbors are okay. It's the kind of collective care that reminds you what community actually means. Relief efforts are still ongoing if you want to donate, and if you're here in Cebu, they need volunteers for repacking relief goods to send to the northern areas.

Please don't go to the northern areas right now if you don't need to. It's not safe, and it's making traffic worse, like last weekend when everyone decided to drive up to see ground zero and donate directly. And if you're just going there for content, you're not helping anyone.

## Moving updates...

I finally understand why people go all-in on smart home setups â€” smart bulbs, locks, cameras, the whole deal. I'm not a homeowner yet, but we're renting a duplex now and I want to make sure everything is as safe as possible. We have one CCTV camera so far with plans to add more. We already use Xiaomi smart products like our air purifier running.

This week I got an email notification that my air purifier's filter needs changing, which is such a neat feature. I wish we had something equivalent here in the Philippines, but Lazada and Shopee aren't really built for that kind of smart home integration. If Amazon could actually deliver here in a week or less, I'd order so much stuff. But most of what I want doesn't ship to the Philippines anyway.
