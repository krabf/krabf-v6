This week went by very quickly. I didn't even notice that next week will be May. May is going to be a busy month for me. I will be traveling but still working from different places. Next week, we will be joining a medical mission. My partner and I decided to join them at the last minute, but we're glad we can help out.

In other *literary* news, I'm reading a book! I'm only 30 pages in but it's still a milestone for me. Last Monday, April 22nd, we attended [Patricia Evangelista's](https://patriciaevangelista.com/) book tour for her latest work, "[Some People Need Killing](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/612869/some-people-need-killing-by-patricia-evangelista/)." It was an absolute privilege to witness this amazing author's talk. The book delves into the emotionally intense subject matter of the Philippines' War on Drugs, yet Evangelista's writing style remains remarkably accessible and easy to follow. [You can also buy the book for someone else.](https://patriciaevangelista.com/ituloyangkuwento)
