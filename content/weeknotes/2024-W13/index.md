It's Holy Week in the Philippines and with stores closed and everyone either flocking back to their home provinces or squeezing in a long weekend vacation, the whole country feels like it's in transit and at a pause at the same time. This is my first experience having a holiday off from work, and I plan to stay at home. I prefer to stay away from crowds because there’s an ongoing [pertussis outbreak](https://www.rappler.com/philippines/list-cities-provinces-that-declared-pertussis-whooping-cough-outbreak-2024/).

I've been experimenting with a productivity app called [Structured](https://structured.app). It combines your calendars and tasks, but I primarily use it to set a time and duration for my daily schedule, allowing me to have a visual timeline of my day. I downloaded the app two weeks ago and subscribed to the annual plan last Friday to better structure my work week. I am hoping to maintain this routine for the next 90 days!
