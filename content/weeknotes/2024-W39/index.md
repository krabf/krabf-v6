It's the last week of September, and I'm ready for this month to be over. It's been exhausting, and I've often felt like I'm just trying to get through each day. I'm looking forward to turning the page to October.

I think all this stress comes from dealing with car stuff (and few work stuff) lately. Had to renew my insurance and take care of a bunch of car-related things. Not my favorite tasks, to put it mildly, but I guess I should be thankful I have a car in the first place. It's a one of my *love-hate thing*, especially given how rough commuting and public transport can be here in the Philippines. Sometimes you need your own vehicle just to get around without losing your mind.

# The Week in Links

üöó Speaking of cars, I spent a good 15 minutes in [slowroads](https://nileane.fr/@nileane/113194188891066173). Thanks to [Nil√©ane](https://nileane.fr/@nileane/113194188891066173). Quite addicting.

üì± Apparently, my used to be favorite camera app was [rejected from the App Store](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/09/24/halide-rejected-from-the-app-store/?ref=krabf.com). Also, turns out I was a bit out of the loop ‚Äî it seems like a lot of folks had fallen out of love with it [a while back](https://new.reddit.com/r/ShotWithHalide/comments/xkc5jf/your_free_updates_to_halide_have_ended/). Apparently, there are tons of [other](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/no-fusion-a-simple-pro-cam/id6444706244) [apps](https://www.mood.camera/) out there using [Process Zero](https://www.lux.camera/introducing-process-zero-for-iphone/) too. I kinda get why people got annoyed when they switched to a subscription model., which I don't subscribe by the way because I do't really use it as much.

üíª [One more thing... Goodbye from iMore](https://www.imore.com/apple/one-more-thing-goodbye-from-imore) - This makes me a bit sad. I remember when I got my first iPad back in 2011. I was so excited about it. I spent so much time setting it up, following all those iMore tutorials. I really enjoyed learning about everything it could do. It feels like such a long time ago now.

üîç [Raycast for iOS seems to be in the works](https://www.raycast.com/blog/series-b). Just signed up for the waitlist! Raycast is my most used utility app and I'm excited for them.

üñáÔ∏è Notion's Notion AI has got a [new face](https://www.notion.so/product/ai), and it's cute and fun. They recently did an [interview](https://www.notion.so/blog/clippy-walked-so-notion-ai-could-run) with [Steven Sinofsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Sinofsky), former leader of the Office product team.

üï∂Ô∏è [Meta's new smart glasses](https://www.theverge.com/24253908/meta-orion-ar-glasses-demo-mark-zuckerberg-interview), Orion, actually look pretty IMO. I like this style of frames. I know it got a lot of hate, but it looks impressive and at least it‚Äôs less bulky than Apple's Vision Pro. Also Alex Heath needs to be in more videos!

üì∞ Gosh, the tech drama this week. [WordPress](https://kevquirk.com/blog/my-thoughts-on-the-wordpress-drama/?ref=krabf.com) and [MKBHD Wallpaper](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2024/09/25/marques-brownlees-panels-backlash-explained/). Mira Murati [leaving OpenAI](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24254431/openai-cto-mira-murati-leaving). Fun week. Yes.

Good Neighbours cover Sabrina Carpenter‚Äôs ‚ÄòEspresso‚Äô for Like A Version. Really obsessed with this cover and their performance! I knew it right away that the inspiration on this was [Lisztomania by Phoenix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BJDNw7o6so), which they mentioned on their [behind the scenes interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY-OSciWP7o).
