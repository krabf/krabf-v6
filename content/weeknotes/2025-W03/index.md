What a packed week in Manila! Started off with three days of pure couple time, which led to one of my biggest concert dreams finally coming true â€” seeing Cigarettes After Sex live. Been waiting for this moment since 2013, and let me tell you, Greg Gonzales delivered that ethereal and heavenly experience I'd always imagined.

We caught Interstellar in IMAX for its 10th anniversary. First time seeing it on the big screen, and wow, what a difference that makes.

I rounded out the week with our annual Kick Off in Filinvest City, spending three solid days with my work crew in Muntinlupa.

One of those rare weeks where everything just clicked. But after this intense week of socializing and meetings, my introverted soul is ready for a solid month of hibernation. Time to recharge those social batteries in the comfort of home.
