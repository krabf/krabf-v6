Last Saturday, I had the awesome experience of seeing Atsuko Okatsuka perform live. I've been following her since the pandemic started, and her videos have been a constant source of joy and laughter in my life.

The highlight of my week though was finally reuniting with my best friend after five long years apart. We missed each other last year when she was in town due to scheduling conflicts, but this time we made sure to carve out time to meet up. It was like no time had passed at all!

‚úàÔ∏è I have been using [Flightly](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flighty-live-flight-tracker/id1358823008) for all my travel since last 2022, and honestly, it's been a game-changer ‚Äî even the free version is spot-on for what I need. As someone who gets pretty wound up about flying (yes I am THAT person constantly digging through emails, PDFs, and texts from my partner just to double-check flight details). The only thing I'm really wishing for is if it could automatically show my seat number after I input my booking reference.
