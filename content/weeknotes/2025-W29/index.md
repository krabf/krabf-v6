I ended up in the ER last Wednesday around 3AM because of a food allergy I never knew I had. The culprit? Bangus â€” the fish practically every Filipino household eats.

I had lunch before an afternoon meeting since I was swamped with video editing. Twenty minutes into the call, I felt like there was something off. When my manager asked me a question, I saw myself on screen and I was completely red. I couldn't even answer properly and kept turning off my camera to check myself.

I felt hot but only on the outside, if that makes sense. Since I was still in the meeting, I quietly called my partner to wake her up. She told me to take antihistamine, which I did, but my heart rate just kept climbing. One look in the mirror and I knew we needed to go to the ER.

The doctor said it's totally possible to develop food allergies later in life. It honestly made me sad because I used to eat fried bangus almost daily. I'm hoping it was just bad fish from the grocery store or something related to red tide season, but I guess I'll have to be more careful now.

Not exactly what I had on my 2025 bingo card.

No links and video/music today as I'm trying to rest from getting from the meds I took.
