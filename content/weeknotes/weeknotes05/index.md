It's such an easy and familiar activity that I've enjoyed before, and I think it'll be a great way to ease back into being active again.

I've been a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock for as long as I can remember. Rear Window definitely takes the top spot. It's a masterpiece that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.
