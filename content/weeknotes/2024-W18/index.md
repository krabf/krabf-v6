Serving at this medical mission in Davao Del Sur fills my heart with joy. Seeing the grateful smiles and relief on people's faces when they receive the care they desperately need is one of life's most humbling experiences. It reminds me that simple acts of kindness and compassion can profoundly impact those struggling with limited access to healthcare. This experience has been a powerful reminder that healthcare is a basic human right, not a privilege.
