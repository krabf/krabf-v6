This week hit me hard mentally.  Suddenly I was drowning in this constant anxiety about whether I'd ever accomplish what I want without messing up at every turn. It wasn't triggered by anything specific. Just this overwhelming sense that I'm running out of capacity. Something inside me simply snapped. Not sick, not reacting to anything particular. Just my mind turning against me. I'm still trying to name whatever this is. Burnout? Anxiety? Guilt? Could this be because of the Philippine Midterm election results? Whatever it is, it feels new and unsettling. 

I've mentioned these episodes to Denz before, these moments where I just mentally shut down without warning. Looking back, I think she sensed something it coming, which explains our packed weekend. Sunday was exactly what I needed. We took Nooning to Car Free Sundays, explored the new Central Park in our area (though the farmer's market wasn't open yet). We went to this cool new cafe and a great spot for breakfast and had an almost perfect Filipino breakfast (no [buwad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daing), sadly). Spent the rest of the day just vibing at home, then went out for ramen and ended the night watching *Final Destination Bloodlines*. Exactly what I needed.

✺ [How Soderbergh Elevates A (Minor) Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfz0OHyCST0&t=92s) *by* [Nerdwriter1](https://www.youtube.com/@Nerdwriter1) - I had to watch the film so I could watch this amazing video essay.

✺ [Tomorrow](https://manuelmoreale.com/tomorrow/?ref=krabf.com)

✺ [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/about/?ref=krabf.com) (easily one of my favorite writers, photographer, walker) released his book [*Things Become Other Things*](https://craigmod.com/books/things_become_other_things/?ref=krabf.com ) earlier this month. Been eyeing a copy since the announcement. Actually saving up for a membership rather than just the book. Worth it for someone whose work has influenced me so much.
