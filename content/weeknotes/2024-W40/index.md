I've burned through half this week overthinking ways to improve my workout routine, hoping to find something I'll stick with. This mental gymnastics is more stressful than actual exercise. I know I should just start working out instead of endless planning. While gym memberships and personal trainers are options, they're not in my budget right now. I'm looking for free workout alternatives that are just as effective. Plus, I've already splurged on new shoes, so extra fitness expenses are out of the question. It's time to stop planning and start moving.

Croissant is a new iOS app designed for cross-posting to Bluesky, Mastodon, and Threads, offering features like threaded posts, image attachments, and alt text. It targets social media users with an affordable pricing model starting at $2.99 per month. I downloaded it, tried the free version, but realized I rarely post to these social media sites.

> We know, when we’re reading a blog, that we’re getting a glimpse into the writer’s active psyche, a tour of their studio as it were — not hearing their thesis presentation or reading their pre-print publication; **hearing from other people _being people_ is part of the appeal of blogs**.

I discovered this channel just a few months back, but I'm increasingly impressed by their projects. What stands out is the blend of uniqueness and humor in each video. It's refreshing to see someone building things for their own self-improvement rather than just chasing views. The creator's genuine enthusiasm for their work shines through, making the content both entertaining and inspiring. It's quickly becoming one of my favorite channels to follow.
