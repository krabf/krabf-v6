It's election season again in the Philippines. To every Filipino with the power to vote this May 12: **Please, vote wisely**.

We’ve been through so much. We’ve seen how corruption, incompetence, and greed have held us back for generations. We've watched political dynasties exchange power, while ordinary people continue to struggle. We deserve leaders who actually care, who show up not just for photo ops, but for real work, real service, and real progress. We deserve better.

Wishing every Filipino voters to dedicate this Sunday evening to thoughtfully considering which candidates have demonstrated genuine commitment to public service, and prepare your list of representatives/candidates who will truly fight for the people's welfare when they cast your ballot tomorrow.
