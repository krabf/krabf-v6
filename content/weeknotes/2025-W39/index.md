It's our first night in the new house. We haven't fully unpacked yet and we're still missing furniture; just what we brought from our previous place for now. The first things we bought were a refrigerator and an electric stove. We ordered a proper mattress this week and I'm genuinely excited because my back is killing me from sleeping on this thin foam mattress we've been using.

Only managed about four hours of sleep because everything felt too new. Couldn't get over that specific smell of a house that's been empty for too long. Kept second-guessing whether we locked all the doors or turned off the lights downstairs. It's weird having a bigger place! My brain hasn't caught up yet.

One step at a time, one box at a time until we get everything set up. No one thought we'd pull this off this year, but here we are.
