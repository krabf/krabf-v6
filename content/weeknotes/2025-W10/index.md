I've been going through my old college photos, and I actually miss it — my friends, the happenings inside and outside the campus, the panic of oversleeping for Math class, and the stress of sitting through it anyway with my misogynist professor. Lately, I've also been seriously missing my favorite professor, who, funnily enough, looked a lot like Michael Angelakos from Passion Pit.
