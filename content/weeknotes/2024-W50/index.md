Spent the weekend with my cousins at Cebu Safari (my second time this year, third all in all lmao.) It's been ages since we all got together, so this trip felt special. We're making a pact to meet up once or twice a year, knowing how work tends to consume our lives. The day was great, filled with catching up, banters, and exploring the safari. My feet, however, might disagree — they were pretty worn out by the end because the drive home through traffic was hell.

ALSO,

Christmas is in two weeks?!?! HOW!!!

🌐 [Zen Browser Beta release](https://zen-browser.app/release-notes/#1.0.2-b.0) -  We're getting closer to a stable release for this promising browser. And they have a new logo which is meh for me ut the community's logo suggestions were impressive. I wish they'd let users choose their own browser icon at this point given there were plenty of logo suggestions. I gave Vivaldi a shot, but it just didn't click for me. When I need to access a site that requires a Chromium-based browser, I'm stuck bouncing between Chrome. Not ideal, but it works for now.
