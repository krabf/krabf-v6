I'm 4 weeks into recovery after gallbladder removal, but this week hasn't been good. I have been experiencing some discomfort in my stomach when I move too much, like getting up from bed or walking longer distances. However, I believe this is simply because my surgical wounds are healing, so it's likely that the internal wounds are healing as well.

Over the past two weeks I have been switching between different web browsers. I am considering writing a blog post about this. I still find myself consistently using the Arc Browser. Its vertical tabs and Little Arc feature are particularly impressive and useful.

I absolutely enjoy making playlists for every occasion and mood. This week, I came across a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX2syo5w7a1cu) that really resonated with me. What I love about this playlist is that it aligns well with my taste in music. Almost every song in this playlist is either already in my personal collection or one that I really enjoy.
