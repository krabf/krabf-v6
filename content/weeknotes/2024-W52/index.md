Happy Holidays, friends! As we wrap up 2024, I'd love to hear your stories. How did you celebrate Christmas? Any memorable meals? Looking back, what moments shaped your year? And what are you dreaming up for 2025? Share your reflections and plans! There's something special about reading everyone's year-end stories.

Looking back, it still surprises me that I managed to document 52 weeks of my life and interesting discoveries. These Weeknotes became more than just updates, they're now a personal archive of my thoughts, challenges, and the random corners of the internet that caught my attention. And my writing has also evolved in ways I didn't expect this year.  Sometimes it felt like I was writing into the void, but the discipline of showing up each week to share a slice of life has been unexpectedly rewarding.

I am wrapping up 2024 and welcoming the New Year in Hong Kong with family. I'm particularly excited about this trip, Hong Kong has always drawn me in with its architecture and culture. There's something captivating about being in a city where past, present, and future blend so seamlessly.

My wish for 2025 is to be less exhausting â€” I'm hoping to find more balance and spend energy on what truly matters. Here's to growing alongside the people and passions we cherish most. See you all next year!


Be kind,

Kush
