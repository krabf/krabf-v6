I recently had the opportunity to meet half of the Philippines team from my company. It was a great experience to finally put faces to names and connect with colleagues I'd previously only known through virtual interactions. I love working remotely, but it made me overthink how people would see me face-to-face. I know that's silly, and I'm trying to stop worrying about stuff like that.

Anyway, once I got there, I had a great time! It was so cool to finally meet everyone and get to hang out with them. The team activities we did made me realize how lucky I am to work with such smart and fun people! I'm glad I went!

üìñ I am in love with [Melanie Richards' reading page](https://melanie-richards.com/blog/new-reading-page/?ref=krabf.com). It's just so beautifully done!

üñºÔ∏è It's a strange coincidence that "The Silence of the Lambs" has been on my mind lately due to work, and [then this interview](https://mubi.com/en/notebook/posts/movie-poster-of-the-week-an-interview-with-dawn-baillie) about its iconic poster popped up in my RSS feed. The article, featuring [Dawn Baillie](https://bltomato.com/) who designed one of my favorite movie posters, feels like a sign. I'm now convinced I absolutely need to rewatch the film soon.

Ô£ø Phil Schiller, the head of Apple‚Äôs App Store and its former marketing chief, [joins OpenAI board](https://archive.is/20240702204831/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-02/apple-to-get-openai-board-observer-role-as-part-of-ai-agreement)as "observer".

üéµ YouTube's new [Erase Song](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/05/youtubes-updated-eraser-tool-removes-copyrighted-music-without-impacting-other-audio/?guccounter=2) tool uses AI to remove copyrighted music from videos while preserving other audio *surgically*. This tool helps creators and productions avoid copyright strikes without sacrificing their entire soundtrack. It's definitely not foolproof, but it's a game-changer for everyone who relies on royalty-free music but still faces occasional false copyright claims. It's a smart solution to a common headache for everyone on YouTube.
