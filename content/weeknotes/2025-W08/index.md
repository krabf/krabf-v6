I enjoy cleaning and organizing, and if I had all the time in the world, I’d probably do it every day. But since I don’t, we booked a home cleaning service. We were shocked — our place always looks tidy when we clean, but somehow, this was the cleanest it’s been in months. It’s crazy how thorough they were to the T!

When I first wanted to start blogging, there was this unspoken rule that you HAD to use WordPress to be taken seriously. That, and you needed to monetize immediately with Adsense and other ad platforms. But all I wanted was a simple space to write down my thoughts. I eventually tried Tumblr instead, but that quickly morphed into just another place where I reblogged interesting stuff rather than creating anything original.

✺ Fast Company’s Co.Design [held a competition](https://www.fastcompany.com/1662130/infographic-of-the-day-inception-contest-winner) to design an infographic diagramming the complex plot of the blockbuster movie Inception. [Rick Slusher's](https://www.rickslusher.com/?ref=krabf.com) [winning entry](https://www.rickslusher.com/Inception-The-Architecture/?ref=krabf.com) is fundamentally a timeline of Inception’s dream architecture, with each character’s trajectory represented. [Here's Rick explaining his thought process in full.](https://www.fastcompany.com/1662130/infographic-of-the-day-inception-contest-winner)

Just watched a Tunnel Vision video about insecam.org (which by the way their video editing is absolutely next level and it is GOALS!) The website lists a livestream from Makati, Philippines, but I can't see the actual feed. Anyone else getting the same thing?
