Weird thing happening lately. Decaf coffee seems to be wreaking havoc on my stomach. It's happened twice in the past two weeks, and I can't quite figure out why. The first time, I just thought it was from drinking too much coffee that day, but the second time made me realize something's definitely off. So no more decaf for me.

Aaaaannnddddd, another Black Friday has come and gone, and my wallet remains untouched,  and I'm already side-eyeing the Cyber Monday deals. Although [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/?ref=krabf.com) is tempting me, but my frugal brain is putting up a fight. For now, I've managed to scratch the shopping *itch* by using an ancient Amazon gift card from five years ago — so I still didn't spend a single peso.

📁 [The File Folder Structure Every Designer Needs](https://danmall.com/posts/the-file-folder-structure-every-designer-needs/?ref=krabf.com) *via* [Chris Glass](https://chrisglass.com/?ref=krabf.com) - I’m a big fan of having a solid folder structure for everything digital. My mom was the original pro at this. She taught me to add years to filenames to make things easier to find. These days, I’ve settled on the Johnny Decimal system, which has been a game-changer. I even introduced it at work, and we’ve been using it ever since. It makes finding assets and collaborating so much simpler!
