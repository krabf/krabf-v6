Getting back into my normal routine has been really tough since my grandfather passed away. I'm still exhausted, both physically and emotionally, from the grieving process. This week was pretty uneventful aside from grabbing some ramen one night. As comforting as it was, it didn't fully recharge me. I'm taking things day-by-day and not pressuring myself to feel "normal" again right away. Grieving takes time, and I'll get there when I'm ready. For now, I'm allowing myself the space to heal at my own pace.
