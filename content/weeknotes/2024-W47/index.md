Only a week until December, and I just roped my partner into a wild challenge: we both need to lose 3kg before 2024 ends. This number might be easy for everyone else but we take things slow in this house HA! Anyway, Since we're both stupidly competitive, this should be fun. The stakes? Loser pays up! If we both hit our goals, we're treating ourselves to a feast (ironic, I know). But if we both fail? Well, we get nothing, which is just sad.

On another exciting browser news, I‚Äôm back to using Safari as my main browser. Zen kept removing my essential tabs, and it was driving me crazy. Six months after ditching Arc, it's `Shift-Command-C` for copying URLs is pure muscle memory at this point, so I try bringing it to every browser. Safari was a pain since it opens the web inspector ruler. After failed tweaks with System Preferences and Automator, I finally fixed it with Shortcuts and Raycast.

üéµ [Billie Eilish is Apple Music's Artist of the Year for 2024](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/11/billie-eilish-is-apple-musics-artist-of-the-year-for-2024/) - I've probably played HIT ME HARD AND SOFT a bunch of times for the past few months and I won't be surprised that Billie Eilish is going to be my top artist of the year. It's truly the GREATEST album for 2024 IMO, and that award is well-deserved.

üì∏ [Can you take a photo of us?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOKSqLOKaEU)

üíª Doing a video about [this news](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/atandt-verizon-reportedly-hacked-to-target-us-govt-wiretapping-platform/) at work and it's crazy I don't see people talking about it.

üêª  [Jeremy Allen White lookalike contest in Chicago draws more than 50 participants.](https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment-and-culture/2024/11/16/glenview-therapist-wins-jeremy-allen-white-lookalike-contest-in-chicago) This sounds fun! We have our version of lookalike from the noontime show, [It's Showtime here in the Philippines](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=showtime+lookalike).

üé∑ Japan has been top of my bucket list for as long as I can remember. I've been building my must-visit spots list and taking notes from my lodi [Craig Mod's](https://craigmod.com/) recommendations. And seeing [this](https://dirt.fyi/article/2024/11/louder-in-japan) pop up in my email just means I NEED to get that visa.

üî† [Chicago Kare by Duane King](https://chicagokare.xyz/) - A faithful reproduction of the bitmap version of the Chicago typeface created by Susan Kare for Apple Computer in 1984.

üì∞ [How Rappler Is Building Its Own Communities to Counter AI and Big Tech](https://gijn.org/stories/rappler-building-communities-counter-ai-big-tech/) *via* [Ben Werdmuller](https://werd.io/view/673df45973bd04a0ed05b852)
> Built on the open source, secure, decentralized [Matrix protocol](https://matrix.org/about/), the app has the potential to become a global independent news distribution outlet, and promises to pave the way for a ‚Äúshared reality‚Äù ‚Äî a call Ressa has been making to counter ‚Äúthe cascading failures of a corrupted public information ecosystem.‚Äù

This is quite impressive for a news organization here in the Philippines. What Rappler is doing is really smart and exactly what news organizations need right now. Most people don't realize that companies like Facebook and Google have way too much control over how we get our news. Rappler has dealt with both [government](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/business/maria-ressa-verdict-philippines-rappler.htm) [harassment](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/why-rappler-won-case-duterte-time-sec-shutdown-order/) and Big Tech's power games, and instead of just complaining, they're doing something about it. They're building their own platform where they can connect directly with readers without anyone getting in the way.
