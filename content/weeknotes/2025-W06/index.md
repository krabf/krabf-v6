Back to (re)building those habits again. I'm sticking with last year's goals â€” not because they failed, but because my consistency took a hit. This year's all about showing up regularly.

Running's been complicated lately. Started back in 2012, but the running scene here has shifted in a way that doesn't sit right with me. There's this weird pressure now, like you're not a "real runner" unless you're doing marathons. That attitude actually pushed me away from marathon running altogether. So I'm taking a different path this year, starting with daily walks; aiming for 5k-10k steps. Sometimes the simpler approach works better.

# The Week in Links

ðŸ”— Still processing the news about [Barbie Hsu's passing](https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/celebrities/barbie-hsu-death/?ref=krabf.com). For those of us who grew up watching Meteor Garden, her Shan Cai was our first taste of Asian romance dramas.

ðŸ”— [In spareness, you find enough.](https://minimalism.com/journal/spareness/?ref=krabf.com) *by* [Leo Babauta](https://zenhabits.net/?ref=krabf.com)

ðŸ”— Trying out [Iconfactory's](https://iconfactory.com/) new app [Tapestry](https://usetapestry.com/) this week. "Tapestry combines posts from your favorite social media services like Bluesky, Mastodon, Tumblr and others with RSS feeds, podcasts, YouTube channels and more. All of your content presented in chronological order, with no algorithm deciding what you should or shouldn't see." I am not sure if my internet is slow or the app is just clunky. But nevertheless, Tapestry reminds me of [Twitterific](https://twitterrific.com/beyond/?ref=krabf.com) (RIP). But I still honestly prefer [Openvibe](https://openvibe.social/?ref=krabf.com) just because I could post/like/repost there. But Tapestry's design is sleek and user-friendly. I'll continue to try it out and see if I run into a problem (which is usually just caused by the need for a subscription).

It's a good year for TV! White Lotus Season 3's trailer just dropped, and Severance Season 2 is finally gracing our screens.
