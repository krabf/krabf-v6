I went a bit wild this weekend and did a thing... or two. I picked up the Casio A168 and the LF-20. At a 20% discount! I've been itching to get one ever since I stumbled across a post from r/Watches. I guess you could call it an upgrade... or maybe a downgrade? I prefer an upgrade from my Apple Watch Series 6's battery life. Either way, I was genuinely surprised to see these classic timepieces were still going strong. I was tempted by the A158, but after doing some research, I found out its backlight was pretty terrible.

The shop I went to didn't have the A1200 in stainless steel, which was a bit of a bummer. I'm still keeping that one on my radar though, especially after seeing some of the cool mods from the community. I'm excited but also kind of worried about this thing I've gotten into.
