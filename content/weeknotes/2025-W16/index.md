Itâ€™s Holy Week here in the Philippines, and for some of us, itâ€™s been a long weekend of sleeping and bedrotting. I didnâ€™t do anything particularly productive, though we did manage a bit of cleaning â€” so at least thereâ€™s that.

# The Week in Links

Â ðŸ”— [Jason Santa Maria](https://jasonsantamaria.com/) has refreshed his home in the web

ðŸ”— [Making Software](https://www.makingsoftware.com/) - A reference manual for people who design and build software. Written and Illustrated by Dan Hollick

ðŸ”— [What to Draw and How to Draw It](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/what-to-draw-and-how-to-draw-it-1913/) *by* Edwin George Lutz *via* [The Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/) - This brought back so many memories from when I first started working at my current company. We used to do a lot of creative exercises to keep things fun, and my guy Kyle would always come up with ones just like this. We'd always joke that we didnâ€™t know how to draw (which, to be fair, was mostly just me). Kyle would walk us through it, starting with simple shapes until, somehow, we had a bird hand-drawn on our paper. Another time, we did a maneki-neko, and it was just such a fun thing to draw together.

ðŸ”— [The Secret History of the Manicule, the Little Hand that's Everywhere](https://www.messynessychic.com/2025/03/07/the-secret-history-of-the-manicule-little-hand-thats-everywhere/) - Iâ€™ve had this sitting open in a tab for about a week now. The manicule is something I grew up seeing everywhereâ€”books, textbooks, even online, just like the article points out with the mouse pointer (pun intended). But I also think about how much meaning a simple pointing gesture can carry, especially in drag. Whether itâ€™s Bob the Drag Queenâ€™s iconic "purse first!" or just a sharp "shush" motion, a pointed finger can say a lot without needing any words.

ðŸ”— [A 1990s Byron Bay A-Frame Home On The Edge Of Nature](https://thedesignfiles.net/2025/03/homes-laura-muirhead-peter-tanevski-byron-bay) - Some day I'll get a house and make have this as one of my inspiration. This jsut feels "home"

ðŸ”— [Short Trip](https://alexanderperrin.com.au/paper/shorttrip/) *by* Alexander Perrin - I came across this while on a quest to find small web games that help me pause and relax my mind.

I love every bit of this music video. I want to write about itâ€”probably soon, when I have the time. For now, I just want to enjoy it.
