[Some weeks ago](https://krabf.com/i-download-way-more-apps-than-i-use/) I mentioned doing an audit of all the apps cluttering up my Mac. It got so ridiculous that I had to stop halfway through because I couldn't figure out which ones to actually delete.

Now I have this pile of unused apps staring at me. Most are completely untouched, some I opened once and never again. A bunch of them have been totally replaced by Raycast anyway. And there's Structured, which I only use on my phone now.

Turns out deciding what to delete is harder than finding what's unused in the first place.

Wander, discover, and read deeply rather than just scroll.
