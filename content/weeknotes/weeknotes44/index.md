Had a fantastic birthday celebration with my partner at a Safari Park. She's always been drawn to zoos and adventures, so an overnight stay there was perfect. We'd been worried about another typhoon hitting after [Kristine](https://www.rappler.com/philippines/weather/tropical-cyclone-kristine-forecast-track-wind-signals-rain-damage-relief-updates-october-2024/?ref=krabf.com), but luck was on our side — the weather turned out beautifully throughout our stay.

In less exciting news, Omnivore really caught me off guard this week. They [shut down](https://blog.omnivore.app/p/details-on-omnivore-shutting-down?ref=krabf.com) after getting acquired by ElevenLabs to work on AI reading app. Now I'm scrambling to replace my perfect Omnivore-to-Obsidian setup. There's a lot of frustrtations in the Discord channel because of this. Testing out [Infoflow](https://www.infoflow.app/ref=krabf.com) and [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper?ref=krabf.com) at the moment. Readwise is also an option, but their pricing is a bit steep — might try my luck asking for a discount.

# The Week in Links

 Apple dropped some exciting new products this week! They unveiled the [M4 Pro and M4 Max](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/apple-introduces-m4-pro-and-m4-max/?ref=krabf.com) chips alongside new [MacBooks](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/?ref=krabf.com). Though they look tempting, I'll stick to my trusty MacBook Pro M1 Max — still going strong after 4 years! The new [Mac mini](https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/?ref=krabf.com) caught my eye, though I definitely don't need it, but WANT it because it's both cutesy and mighty. They also launched colorful new [iMacs](https://www.apple.com/imac/?ref=krabf.com) that would look perfect in any family home.

📺 [Marathon](https://marathontv.app/?ref=krabf.com) is like Letterboxd but for TV (series). The app looks great and has nice haptic feedback. Problem is, it's quite sluggish. Tried writing a review for the whole Slow Horses series bit it went through S1E1 only and hen I tried to delete it, there was no confirmation and when had to hit the back button to see it was actually gone.

His photos showcase how Taiwan's architectural scene blends cultural heritage with modern urban development.
