Singapore's heat and humidity is no joke. I know the Philippines can get brutally hot these past few months, but the humidity in Singapore is on another level when it comes to getting completely drenched in sweat. Just walking a few meters outside and you're drenched in sweat. But man, what a modern, beautiful city with all the tall buildings and *GREAT* transportation. I loved how walkable everything was, with the train stations connected right to the major places you'd want to go.

And of course I had to make a midnight run at [Mustafa](https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/Attraction_Review-g294265-d2139541-Reviews-Mustafa_Centre-Singapore.html) for the goods. Can you believe the taxis there cruise down the highway at over 100? Definitely made me want to rent a car and experience that myself, though you know I'd keep it a reasonable 80 since I'm a careful driver. The easy commuting was SO convenient compared to being stuck in brutal traffic jams. Singapore has its modern amenities down pat with the walkability and transit even if the heat and humidity take some getting used to!

Singapore is an awesome place overall but it can be really expensive. I would rather eat at Hawker Centres than eat at a fancy restaurant or order Grab.

✺ I tried out [Memex](https://memex.garden/) way back when it first launched, but it was pretty rough around the edges at that point. It's a bookmarking tool that lets you save, highlight, and take notes on stuff you find online, right in your browser. Kinda similar to Omnivore, which I've been using. But I've noticed they've been pushing out updates like crazy lately, so I'm curious to give it another shot. The constant improvements have definitely caught my eye. Anyone else here using Memex these days? I'd love to hear if it's gotten better and more intuitive to use.

Okay, I'm glad someone made a video about this because I have also been wondering why AI companies use the sparkles emoji or at least use the same logo for all their AI features.
