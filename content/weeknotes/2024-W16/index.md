The heat in Cebu and the Philippines is unbearable. Last Wednesday, even inside our home, right after I showered, the sweat just started pouring out and it made me feel sticky and so damn uncomfortable. Didn't even let me enjoy the feeling of being clean at all.

I'm still working on the categories page for my website, but the code especially the CSS, is still incomplete. I haven't had enough time to finish writing it, and I might need some help from ChatGPT, just like I did with my other projects. I don't expect ChatGPT to provide me with the entire solution, but it can help me refine the code.

✺ [How I Reimagined My Digital Storage System](https://hulry.com/digital-storage/?ref=krabf.com) by Rahul Chowdhury - Rahul write about their journey of finding an optimal digital storage solution for their large video files and settled on a hybrid approach, using cloud storage for frequently accessed files and external hard drives in a RAID 1 configuration for archiving large video and photo files. I've got a kind of similar system for storing my files. I make sure to backup everything from my computer's local hard drive to an external HDD every month. It's not the fastest process, for sure and it usually takes a whole day to complete the backup but it's totally worth it for the peace of mind it gives me.
