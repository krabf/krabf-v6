It's been a busy week of cleaning and decluttering around here. We're signing on for another year at our place, so it felt like the right time to get everything in order. There's something satisfying about sorting through all our belongings, making everything neat and tidy. Giving the place a "fresh start". The funny thing is, all this organizing means we've now got more space for... you guessed it, more stuff. I know, I know — not exactly in line with that minimalist, nomadic lifestyle we sometimes pretend we're *aiming* for. Still, it feels good to clear out the clutter. Maybe this year we'll finally embrace that less-is-more lifestyle. Or maybe we'll just enjoy our newly organized space until it's time to do this all over again next year. Either way, at least for now, everything has its place — and that's pretty nice.

✺ Silvio Rizzi's new [Reeder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reeder/id6475002485) app launched this week, integrating RSS feeds with diverse content sources like podcasts, YouTube, and social media. Despite mixed reviews, I considered trying it as an alternative to my buggy NetNewsWire iOS app. However, discovering that OPML import is behind a paywall quickly changed my mind. For now, I'm sticking with NetNewsWire, hoping for improvements or a more accessible alternative in the future.

✺ [Tapedeck.org](http://www.tapedeck.org/index.php) is a project of [neckcns.com](http://www.neckcns.com), built to showcase the amazing beauty and (sometimes) weirdness found in the designs of the common audio tape cassette.
