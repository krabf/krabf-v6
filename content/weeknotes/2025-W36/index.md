I didn't write anything for August at all. I figured I'd take the month off since it was my birthday month and I wanted to "treat myself" by not overthinking my blog ‚Äî how it looks, what to add, fonts, accessibility, all that stuff.

The creative break was brutally suffocating to be honest. I was already on a streak of writing regularly and had my links saved for The Week in Links section, plus music and videos I wanted to share. But because I forced myself to pause for a month, I was itching to write something the entire time! The only productive thing I did for my personal projects wasn't even for my blog, it was an Obsidian revamp. My vault felt cramped and bloated with plugins and CSS I never used. So I created a fresh vault, copied over my files, switched to IBM Plex (kind of like my favorite), and now I have a fast, functioning PKM system.

Turns out taking a creative break isn't always refreshing. Sometimes it just reminds you why you started creating in the first place. September feels like a good month to get back to it.
