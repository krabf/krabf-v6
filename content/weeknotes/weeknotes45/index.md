What a week with the election results. Everything is/was just so disappointing and frustrating AAAACCKK all the things! Reminds me of the situation in the Philippines last 2022. My algorithms were all off, which isn't surprising given how the tech companies seem to have their own agendas so I tried to avoid doomscrolling. I know I'll be mulling this over for a while, trying to figure out where things went wrong. But I also don't want it to consume me completely.

**Hoping** we can move forward productively, even if the way ahead feels unclear right now.

# The Week in Links

🐴 Folks are moving away from Arc Browser and looking to other alternative browsers that [don't try to be cool.](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24279020/browser-company-ai-browser-arc) And i'm glad people are discovering [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/), my current browser of choice (unless I odn't stumble upon another browser.) But this week I discovered [Horse Browser](https://browser.horse/), a browser built for professionals who demand focus and efficiency. It's got a tree-like tab management that they call Trails and could even add folders straight from the Tabs, just like Arc. It's Electron and it's $20/year or $60 lifetime — so no, thank you. But would be nice to have a trial (like no payment at all) for this browser to know if it's worth the price.

>“Hours before the opening of MUBI Fest Istanbul 2024, which we have been meticulously planning for months, and which was announced a few weeks ago and sold out days ago, we were informed that the screening of “Queer” – the festival’s opening film – has been banned by a decision of the Kadıköy District Governorate of Istanbul,” event officials explained in a written statement via their Instagram profile.

🖼️ [midcenturyclassical.com](https://midcenturyclassical.com/) - I had this sitting on my tab for the whole week and I kind of forgot how I stumbled upon this website. It's a personal collection by Jonas (it says on the Instagram account). And it's a wonderful collections site.
