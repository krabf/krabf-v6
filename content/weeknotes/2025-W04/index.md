This week was about finding my footing again. The recent layoffs hit hard, especially losing the person I've looked up to as my mentor. The past few weeks have been rough, there's this lingering heaviness that won't quite shake off. Our virtual meetings feel different now with only fewer familiar faces. Work doesn't feel quite the same, but I'm settling in, one day at a time.

ðŸ”— ["Tim C., core of the Apple"](https://x.com/BenStiller/status/1882792326982250665). Ben Stiller, Executive Producer of *Severance*, posted a video of Apple CEO Tim Cook visiting Lumon Industries. He enters the office's elevator and undergoes the severance procedure, which divides his memories between his work and personal life. Cook arrives to the severed floor as his "innie," wearing a "Tim C." name tag. [Stephen Hackett](http://512pixels.net/) describes this perfectly:

I wonder if the innie or the outie [attended Trumpâ€™s inauguration](https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/20/tim-cook-trump-inauguration-2/) earlier this week [after helping pay for it](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/03/tim-cook-apple-donate-1-million-trump-inauguration).  *[512 Pixels](https://512pixels.net/2025/01/welcome-tim-c/)*
