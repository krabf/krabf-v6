I've always loved espionage and crime TV shows. After Mindhunter was cancelled, I kept searching for similar shows but nothing quite clicked. Then Slow Horses came along — probably the best thing Apple has done. Actually discovered it pretty late, only hearing about it during the recent Apple Event when people were talking about the new season. Ended up binge-watching all four seasons, burning through each one in a day.

Now I'm back to searching for something similar. Tried Only Murders in the Building. It's fun but not quite hitting the mark. Here's hoping either another good spy show comes along, or [Severance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwP6M9zS_pQ) finally drops its new season.
