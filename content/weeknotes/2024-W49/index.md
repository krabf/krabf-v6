[Spotify](https://www.fastcompany.com/91241436/internet-furious-2024-spotify-wrapped-ai-boring?partner=rss) and Apple Music Wrapped are out, but I'm holding off for [last.fm](https://www.last.fm) Rewind. Using both platforms might skew my listening stats, so I'm sticking with last.fm. Last year's Rewind was *impressively* accurate, so I'm betting on it again this time.

I'm putting up a Media Diet 2024 or some sort before (probably after) heading out for the holidays.

Since I'm leaving my laptop behind this break, I'll still plan to update my weeknotes, just a bit later than usual.

üì∞ The Verge just [launched a subscription model](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24306571/verge-subscription-launch-fewer-ads-unlimited-access-full-text-rss) with some great perks: full-text RSS, access to premium newsletters, and an "improved ad experience" ‚Äî which seems totally backward. If subscribers are already paying, why are ads even in the picture? Manuel Moreale [wrote](https://manuelmoreale.com/the-correct-amount-of-ads-is-zero/?ref=krabf.com) something about this that resonates with me. I'm not sold on paying for news sites. **There are far better ways to make information accessible to everyone**. Sure, these sites need to keep the lights on, but this paywall approach is just another capitalist move that pushes people away. It's why so many folks end up scrolling through [Facebook](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/02/02/5-facts-about-how-americans-use-facebook-two-decades-after-its-launch/) for their [daily news](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6424427/#sec003) instead of seeking out quality journalism.
