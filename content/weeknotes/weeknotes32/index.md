After my January surgery, I'm finally back to running, albeit at a slower pace. I'm using a run/walk method, doing nine-minute walk/run but the other way around (9-walk, 1-run), as I'm not quite ready for intense workouts yet. Planning to get new pair soon since my 4-year-old New Balance are on their last legs. I'm incredibly grateful to be active again and working on my fitness. This time around, I feel a new sense of commitment and excitement for the journey ahead.

My partner and I just celebrated two years together. Two years! I'm so grateful to spend this lifetime with her.
