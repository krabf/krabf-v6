My grandfather passed away on May 29, 2024, just a day after I returned home to our province. It's like *lolo* waited for me to come back home before letting go. Those last hours with him were the hardest I've ever heard. Seeing him struggle, and hearing his labored breaths tore me apart inside. Every wince, every groan was just so painful.

My *lolo* was a true father figure who went above and beyond. From 5th grade through high school, he drove me to school on his motorcycle every single day, no matter the weather. When it came time for me to leave for college in Cebu, I saw the sadness but also the pride in his eyes as he said our daily rides would end. Though not one for showy affection, lolo made sure we always felt cherished through his simple, devoted acts of love.

I am happy I was able to see him for the last time. I love him and I'm going to miss him.
