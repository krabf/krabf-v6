It's 2025, and I’m determined to keep my Weeknotes alive! I just got back from my Hong Kong trip yesterday (January 4), and ending the year at Disneyland was the perfect way to wrap up 2024 and start 2025. I began the year with a happy heart and a clear mind, and I’m forever grateful to the Universe for giving me the chance to visit Disneyland and experience Momentous. I started crying as soon as it began because the first song was *You’ll Be in My Heart* from *Tarzan*, the very first Disney movie I remember watching as a kid, at least this was when I was old enough to understand what a movie was.

How was your New Year? I haven’t finalized my goals and resolutions yet. I’m keeping it simple this time by sticking to last year’s goals mainly because I wasn’t great at following through with them.
