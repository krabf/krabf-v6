It's been raining all week here in Cebu. Perfect for just staying at home and doing nothing, of course except I am working from home... which by the way I am truly grateful for despite knowing how tough it is out there in the media industry. I had a pretty productive week at work despite the gloomy weather. I finished off 4 videos this week which was definitely a cause for celebration. Knocking out that many edits and getting everyone's seal of approval felt really good. A nice little dopamine boost to make the long hours worthwhile.

💻 I've seen little discussion about the new [Daylight](https://daylightcomputer.com/) e-paper display. While I typically avoid e-ink due to my eyesight issues, the claims of crisp text and interactive animations have piqued my interest. Has anyone had hands-on experience with this display that could share their impressions?
