description = "Just found out about Binocular Shot. Part of me is disappointed because I've had this weird fascination with films featuring binocular shots ever since watching The Grand Budapest Hotel. Thought I might create something around this someday. But I'm also secretly pleased because now I have a list of films I've missed. Time to dive into some new viewing material."
