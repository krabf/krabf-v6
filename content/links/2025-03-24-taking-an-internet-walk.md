description = "Love this. I live for the term and it's usually what I do. Friends and family often ask why I much prefer using my laptop than the phone. This is mainly because I go deep down the rabbit hole of an internet walk and sure, I could save things to my read-it-later, but there's something deeply satisfying about exploring the web on a bigger screen with multiple tabs branching in different directions. The phone just can't match that experience. â€” <em>by</em> <a href=\"https://syllabusproject.org/spencer-chang/\">Spencer Chang</a> and <a href=\"https://syllabusproject.org/kristoffer-tjalve/\">Kristoffer Tjalve</a>"
