description = "The Swiss government unveiled a new design for its passport, created by Geneva-based studio <a href=\"https://retinaa.ch/work/new-swiss-passport/?ref=krabf.com\">RETINAA</a>. The passport features intricate 3D-modeled reliefs of Switzerland's landscapes, custom typefaces, and security features that use water as a recurring theme to symbolize movement and connection. The color palette shifts through a gradient inspired by the country's diverse landscapes, and under ultraviolet light, hidden details emerge, creating a layered, interactive experience. It is so beautifully made. I want to see and hold one in person."
