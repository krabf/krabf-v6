description: Grocery shopping is genuinely one of my favorite adult activities, but the checkout lines at major stores like mall supermarkets, Landers, or S&R are painfully long. My partner and I have developed this little game to pass the time. We would challenge each other to spot specific words on signs, products, or displays around us. Simple, free entertainment that keeps our minds sharp while we're stuck waiting to pay for overpriced essentials.
