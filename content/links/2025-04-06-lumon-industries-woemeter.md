description = "Quick write-up on one of the standout props from Severance Season 2. Seriously, the amount of effort that went into it is wild. Massive credit to the props team (pun fully intended). The level of detail isn't just impressive! It's intentional. Everything feels like it belongs in that world, down to the most mundane object. You can tell they're not just filling space; they're building layers into the story with every item that shows up on screen."
