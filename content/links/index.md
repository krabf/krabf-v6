  description="I've always been obsessed with making sure continuity is tight and schedules are followed. But no matter how much we plan and double-check, there are still mistakes that show up later, whether in post or during public screenings. It's frustrating because these are things we thought we had under control but clearly didn't. *...the process of cleaning up a film for newer formats like Blu-ray and 4K — which is deeply wrong. This is a much bigger topic on which I have very strong thoughts and the hottest of takes.* I actually have the same thoughts. trying to clean them up often just erases a lot of the original feel of these films. I'd rather watch something a little rough around the edges than something that looks unnaturally polished."

We used to do a lot of creative exercises to keep things fun, and my guy Kyle would always come up with ones just like this. We'd always joke that we didn't know how to draw (which, to be fair, was mostly just me). Kyle would walk us through it, starting with simple shapes until, somehow, we had a bird hand-drawn on our paper. Another time, we did a maneki-neko, and it was just such a fun thing to draw together."

The manicule is something I grew up seeing everywhere—books, textbooks, even online, just like the article points out with the mouse pointer (pun intended). But I also think about how much meaning a simple pointing gesture can carry, especially in drag. Whether it's Bob the Drag Queen's iconic *purse first!* or just a sharp *shush* motion, a pointed finger can say a lot without needing any words."

  title="Keep moving"
  description="*Among the people I've witnessed working through crises in their work and lives, the one pattern that comes up over and over again is making art. Art brings us back to ourselves, helps us root in our own agency and creative power, makes space for the joy of craft and play, and reminds us of our purpose in the world. On dark days, it's easy to think that there's no room for art, because the work of survival is so demanding. But art doesn't merely take time—it gives time and [energy back](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/energy-makes-time). It renews our spirits and the spirits of everyone who sees or hears or experiences the art, who receives the art as it's intended: as a gift.*"

  title="Severance and Philippine Psychology"
  description="*In Philippine psychology, this is similar to the dichotomy of loob (interior) and labas (exterior), except that we are more aware of what's within us. Most of the time, it's the outie that we try to control through embodied processes such as timpi (to contain) and sikmura (to stomach).* *Timpi* and *sikmura* aren't just practices we consciously choose, they're more like survival instincts that kick in, especially in Filipino work culture where hierarchy and pakikisama often take center stage. You don't always realize you're doing it until you're already deep in it — holding back a reaction in a tense meeting, smiling through a comment that didn't sit right, or swallowing discomfort just to keep the peace."

  title="How do animals sound across languages?"
  description="*How can cultures hear the same physical sounds yet translate them into language so differently?* Analyzing animal onomatopoeia across languages can demystify how we shape sound into meaning. *If a cow's moo can interpreted so differently across cultures, how many other sounds might we experience uniquely through our linguistic filters? Whether cows go *moo*, *meuh*, or *음메*, onomatopoeia connects us to the natural world in a way that transcends linguistic boundaries. It invites us to play with sound, to embrace the quirks of language, and to recognize our shared instinct to listen and interpret. In doing so, onomatopoeia reminds us that even the simplest of sounds can tell a universal story, endlessly fascinating in its infinite variations.* *by* [Vivian Li](https://pudding.cool/author/vivian-li/)"

The color palette shifts through a gradient inspired by the country's diverse landscapes, and under ultraviolet light, hidden details emerge, creating a layered, interactive experience. It is so beautifully made. I want to see and hold one in person."
