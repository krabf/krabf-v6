✺ [Website Manifesto ...a living document subject to encouraged to change/evolve/grow](https://fromemily.com/website-manifesto/?ref=krabf.com) *by* [Emily Moran Barwick](https://fromemily.com/?ref=krabf.com)
> I want to avoid nicheifying myself and my work—[trapping myself in any one "frame."](https://fromemily.com/hi-im-terrified/#hi-im-existentially-angsty-as-fuck) I want this website to hold space for work that is joyous, irreverent, snarky, deadly serious, utterly frivolous, poignant, pointless, labored over, shat out in a sitting, inspiring, helpful, self-indulgent, humorous, biting, sarcastic, empathetic, armored, vulnerable, and ALL THE THINGS I am and can be all at once. I want this website to reflect (as much as a website can) the fullness of a human. (No pressure, website...)

✺ [The Movie Mistake Mystery from "Revenge of the Sith"](https://fxrant.blogspot.com/2025/04/the-movie-mistake-mystery-from-revenge.html) -  Ever since I took an editing class and worked hard to be the "best" AD in class and even in town. I've always been obsessed with making sure continuity is tight and schedules are followed. But no matter how much we plan and double-check, there are still mistakes that show up later, whether in post or during public screenings. It's frustrating because these are things we thought we had under control but clearly didn't.
> ...the process of "cleaning up" a film for newer formats like Blu-ray and 4K — which is deeply wrong. This is a much bigger topic on which I have very strong thoughts and the hottest of takes.

I actually have the same thoughts. trying to "clean them up" often just erases a lot of the original feel of these films. I'd rather watch something a little rough around the edges than something that looks unnaturally polished.

✺ [What to Draw and How to Draw It](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/what-to-draw-and-how-to-draw-it-1913/?ref=krabf.com) *by* Edwin George Lutz *via* [The Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/) - This brought back so many memories from when I first started working at my current company. We used to do a lot of creative exercises to keep things fun, and my guy Kyle would always come up with ones just like this. We'd always joke that we didn't know how to draw (which, to be fair, was mostly just me). Kyle would walk us through it, starting with simple shapes until, somehow, we had a bird hand-drawn on our paper. Another time, we did a maneki-neko, and it was just such a fun thing to draw together.

The manicule is something I grew up seeing everywhere—books, textbooks, even online, just like the article points out with the mouse pointer (pun intended). But I also think about how much meaning a simple pointing gesture can carry, especially in drag. Whether it's Bob the Drag Queen's iconic "purse first!" or just a sharp "shush" motion, a pointed finger can say a lot without needing any words.

✺ [Digital Echoes and Unquiet Minds](https://www.chrbutler.com/digital-echoes-and-unquiet-minds) *by* [Christopher Butler](https://www.chrbutler.com/)

> As more aspects of our lives generate digital echoes, they force an ambient awareness of being perpetually witnessed rather than simply existing. 
> 
> This transforms even solitary activities into implicit social interactions. It forces us to maintain awareness of our "observed self" alongside our "experiencing self," creating a kind of persistent self-consciousness. We become performers in our own lives rather than merely participants.

✺ [Keep moving](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/keep-moving/) *by* [Mandy Brown](https://everythingchanges.us/)

> Among the people I've witnessed working through crises in their work and lives, the one pattern that comes up over and over again is making art. Art brings us back to ourselves, helps us root in our own agency and creative power, makes space for the joy of craft and play, and reminds us of our purpose in the world. On dark days, it's easy to think that there's no room for art, because the work of survival is so demanding. But art doesn't merely take time—it gives time and [energy back](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/energy-makes-time). It renews our spirits and the spirits of everyone who sees or hears or experiences the art, who receives the art as it's intended: as a gift.

✺ [Lumon Industries WoeMeter](https://make3.co/work/woemeter/?ref=krabf.com) - Quick write-up on one of the standout props from Severance Season 2. Seriously, the amount of effort that went into it is wild. Massive credit to the props team (pun fully intended). The level of detail isn't just impressive! It's intentional. Everything feels like it belongs in that world, down to the most mundane object. You can tell they're not just filling space; they're building layers into the story with every item that shows up on screen.

✺ ["Severance" and Philippine Psychology](https://sikodiwa.substack.com/p/severance-and-philippine-psychology) *by* [Sikodiwa](https://sikodiwa.substack.com)

> In Philippine psychology, this is similar to the dichotomy of loob (interior) and labas (exterior), except that we are more aware of what's within us. Most of the time, it's the outie that we try to control through embodied processes such as timpi (to contain) and sikmura (to stomach).

*Timpi* and *sikmura* aren't just practices we consciously choose, they're more like survival instincts that kick in, especially in Filipino work culture where hierarchy and pakikisama often take center stage. You don't always realize you're doing it until you're already deep in it — holding back a reaction in a tense meeting, smiling through a comment that didn't sit right, or swallowing discomfort just to keep the peace.

✺ [How do animals sound across languages?](https://pudding.cool/2025/03/language/?ref=krabf.com) *"How can cultures hear the same physical sounds yet translate them into language so differently?"* Analyzing animal onomatopoeia across languages can demystify how we shape sound into meaning. *by* [Vivian Li](https://pudding.cool/author/vivian-li/)

> If a cow's moo can interpreted so differently across cultures, how many other sounds might we experience uniquely through our linguistic filters? Whether cows go "moo", "meuh", or "음메", onomatopoeia connects us to the natural world in a way that transcends linguistic boundaries. It invites us to play with sound, to embrace the quirks of language, and to recognize our shared instinct to listen and interpret. In doing so, onomatopoeia reminds us that even the simplest of sounds can tell a universal story, endlessly fascinating in its infinite variations.

✺ [Statistically, When Will My Baby Be Born?](https://maggieappleton.com/birth-probability/?ref=krabf.com) by Maggie Appleton — Just amazed at how this is made.

The Swiss government unveiled a new design for its passport, created by Geneva-based studio [RETINAA](https://retinaa.ch/work/new-swiss-passport/?ref=krabf.com). The passport features intricate 3D-modeled reliefs of Switzerland's landscapes, custom typefaces, and security features that use water as a recurring theme to symbolize movement and connection. The color palette shifts through a gradient inspired by the country's diverse landscapes, and under ultraviolet light, hidden details emerge, creating a layered, interactive experience. It is so beautifully made. I want to see and hold one in person.

I live for the term and it's usually what I do. Friends and family often ask why I much prefer using my laptop than the phone. This is mainly because I go deep down the rabbit hole of an internet walk and sure, I could save things to my read-it-later, but there's something deeply satisfying about exploring the web on a bigger screen with multiple tabs branching in different directions. The phone just can't match that experience.

When I first wanted to start blogging, there was this unspoken rule that you HAD to use WordPress to be taken seriously. That, and you needed to monetize immediately with Adsense and other ad platforms. But all I wanted was a simple space to write down my thoughts.

✺ ["Tim C., core of the Apple"](https://x.com/BenStiller/status/1882792326982250665). Ben Stiller, Executive Producer of *Severance*, posted a video of Apple CEO Tim Cook visiting Lumon Industries. He enters the office's elevator and undergoes the severance procedure, which divides his memories between his work and personal life. Cook arrives to the severed floor as his "innie," wearing a "Tim C." name tag. [Stephen Hackett](http://512pixels.net/) describes this perfectly:

✺ [Design ideas: e-menu for a food spot](https://blog.readymag.com/design-ideas-for-e-menu/?ref=krabf.com) *by* [Readymag](https://readymag.com/?ref=krabf.com) - I appreciate restaurants that put real thought into menu design. Here in the Philippines, most places stick to basic wall menus above the cashier or bulky menu books crammed with infographic-style layouts. During peak pandemic, I tried launching a fancy e-menu with QR codes in my hometown. The timing wasn't great - most folks weren't ready for digital menus, and not everyone had reliable access to smartphones. A bit ahead of its time, perhaps.

Manuel Moreale [wrote](https://manuelmoreale.com/the-correct-amount-of-ads-is-zero/?ref=krabf.com) something about this that resonates with me. I'm not sold on paying for news sites. **There are far better ways to make information accessible to everyone**. Sure, these sites need to keep the lights on, but this paywall approach is just another capitalist move that pushes people away. It's why so many folks end up scrolling through [Facebook](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/02/02/5-facts-about-how-americans-use-facebook-two-decades-after-its-launch/) for their [daily news](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6424427/#sec003) instead of seeking out quality journalism.

This is quite impressive for a news organization here in the Philippines. What Rappler is doing is really smart and exactly what news organizations need right now.

Others migrate to different services that don’t interoperate. Some vanish entirely. Each shift requires rebuilding, and the process of finding the people you once knew and the communities you once valued is laborious. Each shift takes its toll, and everyone has a limit of how much energy they’re willing to expend on a new platform that will eventually, like its predecessors, join the graveyard of defunct websites. And with the shift, old posts and conversations are lost to abandoned accounts or, eventually, server shutdowns.

✺ ["Millennials are saying, 'No, I don't want your stuff. I barely want my stuff.'"](https://archive.is/20241014163340/https://www.businessinsider.com/millennial-gen-x-boomer-inheritance-stuff-house-collectibles-2024-10) - This is so relatable. Every middle-class Filipino family seems to have a hoarding problem, passing down stuff to children who don't want it A.K.A me. In our house, this turns into a yearly debate each December when we tackle the dreaded cabinet cleaning. It's our annual tradition of arguing over what to keep and what to finally let go.

✺ [You should be using an RSS reader](https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/#read-receipts-are-you-kidding-me-seriously-fuck-that-noise) - I've always had a soft spot for RSS since I was younger. When Tumblr added RSS support, I jumped on it to keep tabs on my favorite blogs. It's such a handy tool that I even pitched it at work as a way to stay updated on news. There's something satisfying about having all your content neatly organized in one place, without the noise of social media or ads even!

Growing up, I found horror movies terrifying, and the events in The Omen left a lasting impression. While I still hate watching horror movies, I've mastered the art of using friends and family as human shields during movie nights.

📷 Leica recently released a new addition to the M-Cameras, the [Leica M11-D](https://leica-camera.com/en-int/photography/cameras/m/m11-d-black). The M11-D enables images with a resolution of either 60, 36 or 18 MP. With a cache of 3 GB, continuous shooting of up to 5 pictures per second with 60 MP is possible. With ISO range from native ISO 64 to ISO 50,000. Full specs is on the [Red Dot Forum](https://www.reddotforum.com/content/2024/09/leica-m11-d-cutting-edge-digital-with-analog-feel/) website. The M11-D also had the hardware-based Leica Content Credentials technology (based on the [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://leica-camera.com/en-int/news/partnership-greater-trust-digital-photography-leica-and-content-authenticity-initiative) framework) that we saw on the [M11-P](https://leica-camera.com/en-int/photography/content-credentials) to protect the authenticity of digital images.

> The Leica M11-D brings the analogue experience to digital photography, but without creating limits. With the Leica FOTOS app, you can integrate the digital workflow into your work whenever you want. Use your device as a camera display to assess your shots and adjust nearly all camera settings to your liking. Once saved, your settings are locked in. The Leica FOTOS app also enables photo transfer, remote control, geotagging and direct editing in Adobe Lightroom, Capture One Pro or the Darkroom app.

✺ [How I Reimagined My Digital Storage System](https://hulry.com/digital-storage/?ref=krabf.com) by Rahul Chowdhury - Rahul write about their journey of finding an optimal digital storage solution for their large video files and settled on a hybrid approach, using cloud storage for frequently accessed files and external hard drives in a RAID 1 configuration for archiving large video and photo files. I've got a kind of similar system for storing my files. I make sure to backup everything from my computer's local hard drive to an external HDD every month. It's not the fastest process, for sure and it usually takes a whole day to complete the backup but it's totally worth it for the peace of mind it gives me.

In other news, just this April 1 someone followed a page on Facebook that they would receive money if they would get a tattoo of the page's logo on their forehead. Immediately the guy did this of course in exchange of money but the next day the page announced it was just for April Fools. Netizens reacted that the page was held accountable for what the person did because not everyone knows what April Fools is, this is not being celebrated here in the Phiilppines too — it's a burgis ideas.

✺ [Suspension of classes due to extreme heat](https://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/cebu-lgus-suspend-face-to-face-classes-due-to-intense-heat) - The heat in the Philippines has been outrageous! The heat index can soar from a scorching 35°C (95°F) to an unbearable 42°C (107°F) in no time. This extreme heat has led to numerous class suspensions, as the conditions make it nearly impossible for students to concentrate or function properly in educational institutions. Like I said before the transition to the new academic calendar was implemented prematurely, and we were ill-prepared for its implementation.

<lite-youtube videoid="vYaNiC4kchg" style="background-image: url(&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vYaNiC4kchg/hqdefault.jpg&quot;);" class="lyt-activated"><button type="button" class="lty-playbtn"><span class="lyt-visually-hidden">Play</span></button><iframe width="560" height="315" title="Play" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vYaNiC4kchg?autoplay"></iframe></lite-youtube>

The timing of this was perfect. Ever since college, I've struggled with maintaining attention span, finding it challenging to sit and read even a single page of a book. Perhaps this stems from the trauma of having to pore over numerous theories and essays every week during my university days. I know it's been five or more years, but that experience seems to have left a lingering impact on my ability to concentrate while reading. (I'm aware this may sound like an excuse, but it's a genuine issue I've always wanted to deal with...)

✺ [Dense Discovery Issue 280](https://www.densediscovery.com/issues/280)
> Working in technology means one thing above all else: chasing scale. There is a reason why much of the tech world is obsessed with growth. Free from physical constraints, digital systems can scale to an incomprehensible size. The appeal of conquering the engineering, design and business challenges of mega-scale is strong, the rewards immense. But ultimately, when our work consists mostly of reconfiguring abstract systems and optimising data flows, we thirst for impact that feels more real and relatable.

Manuel reminds me blogging should be self-expression, not a chore.
