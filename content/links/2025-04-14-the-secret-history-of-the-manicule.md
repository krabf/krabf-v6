description = "I've had this sitting open in a tab for about a week now. The manicule is something I grew up seeing everywhereâ€”books, textbooks, even online, just like the article points out with the mouse pointer (pun intended). But I also think about how much meaning a simple pointing gesture can carry, especially in drag. Whether it's Bob the Drag Queen's iconic *purse first!* or just a sharp *shush* motion, a pointed finger can say a lot without needing any words."
