description = "*Among the people I've witnessed working through crises in their work and lives, the one pattern that comes up over and over again is making art. Art brings us back to ourselves, helps us root in our own agency and creative power, makes space for the joy of craft and play, and reminds us of our purpose in the world. On dark days, it's easy to think that there's no room for art, because the work of survival is so demanding. But art doesn't merely take timeâ€”it gives time and [energy back](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/energy-makes-time). It renews our spirits and the spirits of everyone who sees or hears or experiences the art, who receives the art as it's intended: as a gift.*"
