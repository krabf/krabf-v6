description = "This brought back so many memories from when I first started working at my current company. We used to do a lot of creative exercises to keep things fun, and my guy Kyle would always come up with ones just like this. We'd always joke that we didn't know how to draw (which, to be fair, was mostly just me). Kyle would walk us through it, starting with simple shapes until, somehow, we had a bird hand-drawn on our paper. Another time, we did a maneki-neko, and it was just such a fun thing to draw together."
