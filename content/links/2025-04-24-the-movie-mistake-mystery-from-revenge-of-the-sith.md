description = "I've always been obsessed with making sure continuity is tight and schedules are followed. But no matter how much we plan and double-check, there are still mistakes that show up later, whether in post or during public screenings. It's frustrating because these are things we thought we had under control but clearly didn't. *...the process of cleaning up a film for newer formats like Blu-ray and 4K â€” which is deeply wrong. This is a much bigger topic on which I have very strong thoughts and the hottest of takes.* I actually have the same thoughts. trying to clean them up often just erases a lot of the original feel of these films. I'd rather watch something a little rough around the edges than something that looks unnaturally polished."
