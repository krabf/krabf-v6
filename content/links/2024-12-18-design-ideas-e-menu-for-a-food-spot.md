description = "I appreciate restaurants that put real thought into menu design. Here in the Philippines, most places stick to basic wall menus above the cashier or bulky menu books crammed with infographic-style layouts. During peak pandemic, I tried launching a fancy e-menu with QR codes in my hometown. The timing wasn't great - most folks weren't ready for digital menus, and not everyone had reliable access to smartphones. A bit ahead of its time, perhaps."
