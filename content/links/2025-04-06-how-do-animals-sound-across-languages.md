description = "<em>How can cultures hear the same physical sounds yet translate them into language so differently?</em> Analyzing animal onomatopoeia across languages can demystify how we shape sound into meaning. <em>If a cow's moo can interpreted so differently across cultures, how many other sounds might we experience uniquely through our linguistic filters? Whether cows go <em>moo</em>, <em>meuh</em>, or <em>음메</em>, onomatopoeia connects us to the natural world in a way that transcends linguistic boundaries. It invites us to play with sound, to embrace the quirks of language, and to recognize our shared instinct to listen and interpret. In doing so, onomatopoeia reminds us that even the simplest of sounds can tell a universal story, endlessly fascinating in its infinite variations.</em> <em>by</em> <a href=\"https://pudding.cool/author/vivian-li/\">Vivian Li</a>"
