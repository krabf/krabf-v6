description: Such a great read. I loved how it brought back that wave of nostalgia from seeing the old interfaces again. I remember how all the translucency in iOS 7 made my iPhone and even my iPad 2 feel instantly more expensive. But as someone who’s always been more of a Mac/laptop person, I’m genuinely excited to see how this design direction evolves in the next macOS. <em>— by</em> <a href="https://www.lux.camera/author/sebastiaan/">Sebastiaan de With</a>
