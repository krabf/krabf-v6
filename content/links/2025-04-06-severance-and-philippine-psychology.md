description = "<em>In Philippine psychology, this is similar to the dichotomy of loob (interior) and labas (exterior), except that we are more aware of what's within us. Most of the time, it's the outie that we try to control through embodied processes such as timpi (to contain) and sikmura (to stomach).</em> <em>Timpi</em> and <em>sikmura</em> aren't just practices we consciously choose, they're more like survival instincts that kick in, especially in Filipino work culture where hierarchy and pakikisama often take center stage. You don't always realize you're doing it until you're already deep in it â€” holding back a reaction in a tense meeting, smiling through a comment that didn't sit right, or swallowing discomfort just to keep the peace."
