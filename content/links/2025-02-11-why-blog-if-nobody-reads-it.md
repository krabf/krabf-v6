description = "*Blogging forces clarity. It makes you structure your thoughts, sharpen your perspective. You stop writing fluff because — let's be honest — you're writing for yourself. And if you can't keep yourself interested, nobody else stands a chance. When you write, you think better. When you think better, you create better.* — *by* [Andy Hawthorne](https://andyhawthorne.uk/?ref=krabf.com)"
